\chapter{Introduction}
The behaviour of electromagnetic waves in periodic media has attracted the human attention for ages, long before anybody perceived that light is an \textit{electromagnetic wave} or that it is the \textit{periodicity} that is responsible for the brilliant and irreproducible colours of opal gemstones and many living creatures, such as various beetles, butterflies, peacocks etc. %{{{
The scientific community started to study the underlying phenomena in the late 19th century when the X-ray scattering was observed on (periodic) crystal lattices and also when the high optical reflection from periodic layers of entirely transparent materials was predicted. % TODO ref
%The technological and scientific boom of the 20th century contributed with many new theoretical approaches, numerical methods and types of periodic structures to the newly born field of \textit{photonics}. With the advent of the 21th century, great progress was also made in the research of \textit{metamaterials}, a specific subset of periodic structures which will be discussed in greater detail in this work. 
% TODO motivation - finish
The key concept in photonic crystal or metamaterial studies is that the electromagnetic properties are defined predominantly by the shape of the structure, while the actual materials that are used to build it can be relatively freely chosen. % This allows one to take into account the technological and economical aspects. 
While it is unlikely that a radically new material will be invented for construction of optical elements, several new phenomena can be obtained by periodic structuring of ordinary materials. The rapid development of this field was enabled by the modern technology of microfabrication, along with the unprecedented power of computers able to predict the structure behaviour.


% TODO introduction ??
% TODO THz science ??
This work focuses on the terahertz (THz) spectral range, which spans roughly from 100 GHz to 10 THz. While the electrodynamic theory presented in this work is scale-invariant and can be used from microwave to optical frequencies, the selected frequency range defined the properties of materials and technological processes available. Compared to the well established optical technology (400---700 THz), the range of materials suitable for THz frequencies gives additional possibilities, such as the use of superconductors, extremely high permittivity dielectrics and tunable ferroelectrics. Additionally, the much longer wavelength of terahertz waves, e.g. 300 $\upmu$m for 1 THz in free space, also enables much easier fabrication of the structures. On the other hand, some materials commonly found in the microwave or optical applications must be avoided, as they exhibit excessively high losses in the terahertz range (such as glass, water, most plastics etc.)

The THz range is located in the spectrum at the boundary of the regions where people use "electronic" or "optical" approaches. At THz frequencies, devices from both paradigms are often seamlessly used together: waves from waveguides can be collimated by lenses, pulses emitted from lumped antenna emitters are detected by electrooptical crystals etc. Yet none of these approaches is optimal for the THz applications; from the electronic point of view, we are for instance still lacking transistors with fast enough response and the microstrip circuits become too lossy at high frequencies. The optical approach is often complicated by the strong wave-optics phenomena such as diffraction, while some light-matter interactions are weaker, limiting the possibilities for e.g. amplitude modulation by Pockels effect. These deficiencies give additional reasons to search for the new possibilities of the photonic crystals and metamaterials operating in the terahertz range.

\chapter{ebars 2014}
In the studies of electromagnetism of photonic structures with a sub-wavelength
periodicity, two main concepts have been employed: that of electromagnetic metamaterials
(MM) and that of photonic crystals (PhC). In both classes of structures, their properties
are due to resonant behavior of the structure at particular frequencies of the
electromagnetic field.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {
In MMs, the energy of the resonant field is localized in a small fraction of the unit
cell volume, which is usually in/near a resonator made of metal or high-permittivity
dielectric ($\varepsilon_r \gg 10$) \cite{vendik2012tunable}. 
The coupling of the resonant field between
neighboring cells is negligible, so the MMs have a small enough spatial dispersion and
their behavior can be described using frequency-dependent effective parameters: the index
of refraction $\Neff$, wave impedance $\Zeff$, permittivity $\eeff=\Neff/\Zeff$ and
permeability $\meff = \Neff\cdot \Zeff$.
}
\item{
By contrast, PhCs are typically made of low-permittivity dielectrics ($\varepsilon_r
\lesssim 12$) which often fill a larger part of volume than what is usual in MMs. The
resonances are strongly influenced by the presence of neighboring unit cells as they rely
on constructive and destructive interferences between scattered (partially reflected)
waves. As a result, the iso-frequency contours of two-dimensional (or three-dimensional)
PhCs often deviate from elliptical (or ellipsoidal) shapes.

In such a general case, the angle of refraction at a PhC interface cannot be computed
using the Snell formula, and it is impossible to use the notion of the
refractive index $N$ in its general sense. Nevertheless, it is possible to find directions of
propagation (namely those parallel to the symmetry axes) where the iso-frequency contours
can be locally approximated by ellipsoidal shape. Close to such directions the
Snell law holds approximately and one may introduce effective indices of
refraction of the PhC for these particular directions \cite{yannopapas2005negative}.
}
\end{enumerate}

It appears, however, that some kinds of photonic structures represent intermediate cases
between PhCs and MMs; this fact did not receive much attention so far. One of the
simplest examples is a square array of cylindrical dielectric rods, oriented parallel to
the electric field of the incident wave; this geometry was treated as a photonic
crystal\cite{plihal1991two} and later as a metamaterial\cite{zhao2009mie,Vynck2009, felbacq2009}. The
effective response of the rod array depends on two parameters only---the ratio of the
unit-cell size $a$ to the rod radius $\rho$, and the dielectric permittivity of the rods
$\varepsilon_r$, whose imaginary part is assumed to be negligible in this paper. Our aim is to
find out which interesting qualitative changes in behavior can be found when these parameters
are continuously changed.

%% TODO reference!
From the practical point of view, the requirement of a high permittivity $\varepsilon_r
\gg 10$ not only restricts the choice of materials but also determines the frequency
range where such values can be attained. 
\cite{zhao2008tunable,zhao2008experimental}
As a rule, the permittivity in dielectrics
decreases in average with frequency except for narrow intervals around resonances, which
are always accompanied by an increased absorption. In this paper, we focus on the microwave and terahertz
range where materials with a high $\varepsilon_r$ exist and the structures can be relatively easily fabricated
\cite{nemec2012resonant,nemec2009tunable}. We restrict our computations to the normal
incidence which implies the propagation along the mirror plane inside the photonic
structure; in this case the notion of the refractive index can be used even when the
structure is in the PhC regime.

In the paper we discuss numerical results obtained during a systematic variation of the
structure parameters. Namely, we show that their relatively minor variations can lead to
a qualitatively changing optical response. We also discuss the somewhat surprising experimental 
results which were previously published  \cite{peng2007}
and summarize the implications for building optical MMs from dielectric rods.

\section{Calculation of effective parameters}

Our structure is defined by a square unit cell with the linear dimension $a$ periodically
distributed in the $yz$ plane; the dielectric rod parallel to $x$-axis with radius $\rho$
and permittivity $\varepsilon_r$ is positioned in its center. We employed the
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation package MEEP \cite{oskooi2010meep} to
obtain the scattering coefficients (complex reflectance $r$ and transmittance $t$) of a
structure with variable number of unit cells along the wave vector direction $k\parallel
z$. The incident wave is polarized $E\parallel x$, periodic boundary conditions were
applied in the $y$-direction. We found that for this geometry the retrieved effective
parameters depend only negligibly on the number of unit cells in the $z$-direction.
Therefore we performed the majority of simulations for a single unit cell only which can
be considered as a thin film with effective properties remaining valid also for the
corresponding bulk structure. The effective parameters were retrieved from complex
transmittance and reflectance spectra \cite{smith2002determination}; in addition, we
developed an algorithm ensuring that the solution is unambiguous, as described in the Appendix.
The retrieved value of the complex effective index of refraction $\Neff(f)$ defines the
magnitude of the wave vector
\begin{equation}\label{eq_wave_vector}
k(f) = 2\pi f \Neff(f) /c\,.
\end{equation}
Note that the retrieval procedure described in the Appendix implies that the wave vector
introduced by Eq (\ref{eq_wave_vector}) is defined in an unfolded reciprocal space. 

A Bragg resonance occurs when an integer number of half-wavelengths fit into one unit cell, i. e.  when
\begin{equation}\label{eq_BZ}
k(f) = \frac{q \pi}{a}\,,
\end{equation}
where $q$ is a non-zero integer. In such a situation the wave vector is located at a
Brillouin zone boundary. The purely real values of $k$ then describe photonic band edges.
In a band edge state, a standing wave appears in the structure and it is characterized by
exactly $q$ nodal planes sectioning each unit cell in the transverse direction to $q+1$
disconnected parts. The band edges delimit a photonic {\itshape Bragg band gap} where
only evanescent waves described by $\Neff''>0$ can exist.
We can write an equation analogous to (\ref{eq_BZ}) for the real part of the refractive
index:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_BZN}
\Neff'(f) = \frac{q c}{2 a f}\,;
\end{equation}
its hyperbolic behavior versus frequency reflects the pinning of the wave vector to the
Brillouin zone boundary inside the Bragg band gap.

Another case of interest where evanescent waves are obtained is that of $\Neff' = 0$
(center of the first Brillouin zone, $q=0$) and $\Neff''>0$. Here the waves exponentially
decay in the medium without any phase change. However, this behavior has a different
origin: it is connected to a plasma-like response of the material ($\varepsilon<0$ or
$\mu<0$) and in this paper we use the term \textit{plasma band gap} to refer to it.

The Kramers-Kronig relations require that for any structure studied, $\Neff'(f)$ [or,
equivalently, $k(f)$] attains and finally crosses the Brillouin-zone boundaries when the
frequency is sufficiently increased. While usually the convention is used that the
corresponding curves are folded back into the first Brillouin zone, in this paper we plot
$\Neff'(f)$ in the original (unfolded) Brillouin zones resulting from the retrieval
algorithm. This can be clearly observed on the dispersion of the refractive index in
Fig.\ \ref{fg_spec}. In this way we retain the information about the number of the nodal
planes intersecting the unit cell, which is important for our discussion.

%panel below with the current scale up to 1.5 THz but magnified nearly over the page
%width; what imaginary part was used for calculations in reality?} 

In the following we first describe in detail three characteristic cases: we compare the
effective parameters computed for three slightly different unit-cell sizes while the rod
radius and the dielectric permittivity are fixed. The comparison of these cases reveals quite
remarkable changes in the optical behavior of the structure. We then complement this
comparison by a continuous scan of the unit-cell sizes in order to obtain an overview of
all possible types of the response for the rod-based geometry.

In Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}, we show the calculated reflectance and transmittance amplitude
spectra, as well as the effective parameters of three representative structures which
have the same rod radii $\rho = 10$~$\upmu$m, but they differ by the unit-cell size $a =$ 120, 100 and 80 $\upmu$m. These
values of $a$ were selected to illustrate three qualitatively different regimes of
behavior.
The dielectric was defined by a simple lossy model with one high-frequency oscillator, its  permittivity was $\varepsilon_r = 100.1 + 0.5\mathrm{i}$ at 500 GHz.


\paragraph{Sparse array}
In Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(a), where the unit-cell size $a=120$~$\upmu$m, we can see two well
separated Mie resonances: the electric one at 680 GHz and the magnetic one at 1030 GHz.
The field distribution of the corresponding modes is sketched in
Fig.~\ref{fg_sketchfield}. The resonance frequencies can be easily identified by an
abrupt drop in the real part of the effective index of refraction $\Neff'$, accompanied
by a sharp peak in its imaginary part $\Neff''$. The Mie resonances in periodic media
without losses must always neighbor a Bragg band gap. For instance, in
Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(a) at frequencies below the first Bragg gap, the electric dipoles
within each rod are directed along the electric field in the rest of the unit
cell. The rods thus positively contribute to the refractive index $\Neff'$ which
progressively grows until it reaches the first Brillouin zone boundary. At this point the
Bragg condition for a photonic band-gap is fulfilled and each unit cell is intersected by
one nodal plane. This is reflected by the dispersion of $\Neff'(f)$ which follows the
first Brillouin-zone boundary in the first Bragg band gap between 400 and 680\,GHz [equivalent to $q=1$ in Eq. (\ref{eq_BZN})]:
$$	\Neff'(f) = \frac{c}{2af}\,. $$
At 680\,GHz the electric Mie resonance occurs which dramatically changes the near-field
photonic properties of the structure. The observed drop in $\Neff'(f)$ and the slope change
in $\Neff''(f)$ mark the plasma-like character of the adjacent part of the band gap which
extends up to the plasma frequency of the Mie resonance (940\,GHz). In this frequency
range the electric dipoles in the rods change their direction and induce an electric field
opposite to the incident one.

For this sparse array of dielectric rods the first magnetic Mie resonance lies at
1030\,GHz, above the plasma frequency of the electric mode. 
The second Bragg band-gap opens at 1010 GHz and, due to the Mie resonance, it is transformed to a plasma band gap at 1030 GHz. The next allowed photonic band starts above magnetic plasma frequencies at 1070 GHz.
Therefore we observe a completely analogous behavior near the magnetic resonance. 

For completeness we note that at 1350 GHz, a third Bragg band gap
starts which, unlike the lower-frequency ones, does not contain any Mie resonances 
[see Fig.\ \ref{fg_spec}(a)].

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering \includegraphics[width=9cm]{img/ERods_1st_and_2nd_Mie_resonance.pdf}
\caption{Sketch of the unit-cell
cross-sections with the resonant modes excited by a plane wave with $\mathbf{E}||x,
\mathbf{H}||y$ and $\mathbf{k}||z$. The first Mie resonance has an electric dipole moment
only, while the second one has a magnetic dipole moment instead. The red-white-blue color
corresponds to the $E_x$ component of the electric field, while the magnetic field is
represented by the arrows. }\label{fg_sketchfield}
\end{figure}

The resonances in the effective permittivity $\eeff=\Neff/\Zeff$ and permeability $\meff
= \Neff\cdot \Zeff$ of a periodic array obviously exhibit shapes very different from the
well-known resonance curves of a damped oscillator\cite{koschny2003resonant}. In the two
separate plasma band gaps we obtain either $\eeff < 0$ or $\meff<0$, i.e. the usual
behavior observed in the reststrahlen bands of resonances. However, in the Bragg band
gaps occurring just below these spectral ranges the behavior of $\eeff$ and $\meff$ does
not have any useful physical interpretation and it can be understood as a purely formal
frequency dependence: we shaded these ranges with light gray in Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}.

\paragraph{Medium array}
When the unit cell size is reduced to $a=100$~$\upmu$m, as depicted in
Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(b), the Mie resonances shift slightly. Interestingly, the electric
resonance frequency increases from 680 to 780 GHz, that of the
magnetic resonance decreases from 1030 to 980 GHz. This can be explained by the
inter-cell coupling: the circulating magnetic field of the first resonance is compressed
when the rods get closer, whereas the magnetic dipoles of the second resonance can couple
more easily to each other in the same situation (see Fig.~\ref{fg_sketchfield}).

The converging of the resonance frequencies is linked to the most important
qualitative change in the spectra: the fact that the magnetic resonance occurs at a
frequency where $\eeff'<0$. The first band gap (lowest continuous frequency region where
$\Neff''>0$) is thus composed of three adjacent regimes: the first Bragg band gap
(425--780 GHz), a plasma band gap (780--980 GHz) and the second Bragg band gap (980--1020
GHz). Every Mie resonance introduces a drop in $\Neff'$, so the following photonic band
(1020--1070 GHz) features a negative index of refraction ($\Neff'<0; \Neff''\approx 0$),
i.e. the phase and group velocities are opposite to each other. We conjecture that the presence of two
Mie resonances in the \textit{first} combined band gap is a necessary and sufficient condition for
$\Neff'<0$ to occur.
% TODO: \cite{shi2007effects} this cite should be elsewhere

Note that the transmittance amplitude reaches quite small values in between the Mie
resonances when they are sufficiently close to each other [Fig. \ref{fg_spec}(b)]. This range forms a
well-defined band with a reflectance-to-transmittance contrast much better than that
observed in a planar Fabry-P\'erot resonator. One layer of dielectric rods with proper
parameters can therefore be applied as a thin, yet very high-contrast filter.

\paragraph{Dense array}
Perhaps an even more surprising change occurs when the rod spacing is further reduced. The Mie resonances get even closer in the
spectrum and eventually they vanish for $a=80$~$\upmu$m [see Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(c)]. The band gap remains at nearly the same spectral
position as in panel (b) of this figure, but, unlike for the medium array, the value of $\Neff'$ does not drop within
the Bragg band gap. In contrast, it is shifted up to the second Brillouin zone boundary
where it meets the second Bragg band gap as clearly seen in panel (c), indicating that
each unit cell is intersected by two nodal planes in this state.

The reason of this behavior is related to the change of the nodal plane topology caused
by the inter-cell coupling. When the rods are far from each other ($a\gtrsim
100$~$\upmu$m), the individual Mie resonances create closed regions delimited by a nodal
surface where the fields are opposite to the rest of the unit cell. Upon reducing the
unit-cell size ($a\lesssim 80$~$\upmu$m), the regions of opposite fields start to overlap
with those from the neighboring cells and the corresponding nodal surfaces interconnect
and open. This pair of open nodal surfaces dividing the unit cell manifests itself by a
qualitative change of the $\Neff'$ spectrum towards a shape typical for one-dimensional
photonic crystals.

\paragraph{Continuous scan of the unit-cell size}
The behavior described above is confirmed by the plots of the complex index of refraction
$\Neff',\: \Neff''$ for a continuously varying unit cell size $a$ from 20 to 200~$\upmu$m
(Fig.~\ref{fg_spacingscan100}). Here, again, the constant values of the dielectric
permittivity $\varepsilon_r=100$ and the rod radius $\rho=10$ \um are used. In the
upper-right corner of both plots, for $a>c/f$, an empty area is left where the
diffraction prevents the determination of effective parameters. 

For an easier interpretation of the results, we draw the most prominent features
schematically in Fig.~\ref{fg_drawn100}. Some of them are common in ordinary
one-dimensional photonic crystals, namely, the photonic (Bragg) band gaps which are
painted in color in Fig.~\ref{fg_drawn100}.

\label{fg_drawn100}
\end{figure}

The Mie resonances are caused by the field confinement near the high permittivity
elements. They always manifest themselves as sharp peaks in the imaginary part of the
index of refraction ($\Neff''$), and in Fig.~\ref{fg_drawn100} they are denoted by thick
solid curves. Their electric- or magnetic-dipole character is identified by the letters
"E" or "M" above the plot, respectively.

As it can be seen in both Figs.~\ref{fg_spacingscan100} and \ref{fg_drawn100}, the pairs
of electric and magnetic Mie resonances form U-shaped curves, at the bottom of which the
resonances come closer in frequency to each other and eventually they disappear when the
unit-cell size $a$ is further reduced. The resonances influence the whole spectra of the
refractive index $\Neff'$, so the position of this U-curve delimits the range of $a$ for
which a photonic band with $\Neff' < 0$ and $\Neff'' \approx 0$ can be found. This
negative-index band is painted in black in Fig.~\ref{fg_drawn100}.

\label{fg_drawn030}
\end{figure}

Note that the frequencies of the Mie resonances deviate from their free-space value when
the rod distance is reduced. In fact, these resonances help to form the photonic band
gaps (both Bragg and plasma band gaps) due to their dispersion. As a consequence these
resonances must be always located inside a frequency range with $\Neff''>0$.

\section{Discussion}
Having analyzed the case of high dielectric ($\varepsilon_r=100$) permittivity rods, we
will draw below implications for building a negative-index MM from available dielectrics.
Another series of simulations implies that reducing the dielectric permittivity has the main effect
to shift all the Mie resonances to higher frequencies (also compared to the photonic
bands). As a result, the band with $\Neff'<0$ gets gradually narrower and, for the rod
permittivity below about 50, we do not find any cell size $a$ that would imply the first
and second Mie resonances in the first photonic band as illustrated for $\varepsilon_r = 30$ in Fig. \ref{fg_drawn030}. This means that the value of
$\varepsilon_{r} \approx 50$ is the minimum for obtaining a negative index of refraction
in any square array of cylindrical rods. Note that one would come to a very similar value
of minimum permittivity for the case of a square array of bars with a slightly different
shape, e.g. a square cross-section. 

A sufficiently high permittivity can be found in the microwave and terahertz ranges, 
in a variety of materials, for example in titanium dioxide with $\varepsilon_r \approx 92$ \cite{nemec2009tunable} 
or in various ferroelectrics like strontium titanate \cite{skoromets2011tuning}. However, practical applications of
the high-permittivity dielectrics in the THz range can be restricted by high dielectric
losses due to low-frequency phonon absorption tails. To our knowledge, there is no
material providing such a high permittivity in the near-infrared or optical ranges. This
eliminates the possibility to build an optical MM with $\Neff'<0$ based on dielectric
rods.
 %\comm{This is a completely insufficient discussion of the "Felbacq" effect; we must
%still discuss this and improve the text. Namely, we must identify why Felbacq has found
%the negative refraction and what are the implications for the phase of the transmitted
%wave}

Finding a valid negative index of refraction $\Neff'$ for a photonic structure implies
that the Snell law can be used to predict the negative refraction at an interface, provided
the isofrequency contours can be well approximated by a circle. This condition is fulfilled
when the resulting wave vector is oriented close to a symmetry axis of the structure, or when 
the wave vector is negligible compared to the reciprocal lattice vector (i.e. $k\ll \frac{\pi}{a}$ and 
thus $|\Neff'| \ll \frac{c}{2af}$). 
In the latter case the iso-frequency contours of the isotropic structure approach a circular shape
near the $\Gamma$-point in the Brillouin zone center.

By contrast, the opposite implication is not necessarily applicable---a structure with a high
enough spatial dispersion can still refract under negative angles, 
yet its refractive index computed along a symmetry axis never reaches negative values and the phase difference across each its 
unit cell is positive and can be comparable to $\pi$.
For example, it was suggested earlier  \cite{Vynck2009} that an array of 
silicon rods ($\varepsilon_r \approx 12$) can constitute a true left handed metamaterial ($\Neff'<0$).
In agreement with the results presented above, we believe that the negative refraction 
is not a sufficient proof of $\Neff'<0$, which would require a much higher permittivity contrast than that of silicon. 
%TODO WTF? We thus believe that the field pattern observed in the simulation is a
%result of photonic crystal properties of the silicon structure: the negative
%refraction occurs thanks to the behavior of higher-order photonic dispersion curves.

We demonstrated that for $\Neff'<0$ not only the high permittivity contrast, but also 
a correct geometry is required. A wedge filled
with an array of square-shaped high-dielectric bars was previously reported to refract
under negative angles \cite{peng2007}. The high filling fraction ($0.44^{2}$)
simultaneously with a permittivity of $\varepsilon_r \approx 600$ clearly qualified this
structure as \textit{dense}. Using the above described approach, we computed its spectra 
qualitatively similar to Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(c) and no band with $\Neff' < 0$ was resulting from our effective index
retrieval. However, when we reproduced the wedge experiment numerically, our simulations
confirmed that it does refract the light under negative angles.
% end of TODO discuss

This structure lies at the boundary between the criteria for MMs and PhCs described in the Introduction.
While its refraction angle cannot be generally computed from the effective refractive index and
its iso-frequency contours have to be used instead (like in PhC), it was proven
\cite{peng2007} to partially retain negative refraction even under randomization of the positions
of the dielectric bars, implying that most of the resonant energy is concentrated inside
the dielectric (which is typical for MM).

\section{Conclusion}
We created and implemented a robust algorithm for a retrieval of effective parameters based on
FDTD simulations. Its main asset consists in an
unambiguous determination of the branch in the computation of the refractive index
$\Neff$. Using this approach, we confirmed numerically that the square array of
dielectric rods with a high permittivity $\varepsilon_r$ exhibits Mie resonances that can
lead to a negative refractive index $\Neff'<0$.

Based on a parametric scan over the rod density, we demonstrated that there are quite
strict requirements for the geometry to obtain a true $\Neff'<0$. For rods which are too
sparse, the electric and magnetic Mie resonances are separated in the spectra
[Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(a)], while for the same rods being too dense [Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(c)],
the Mie resonances come close to each other and disappear; in such a case an ordinary
Bragg photonic band gap is formed which does not provide a negative index of refraction.

Apart from the geometric requirements, we found that the existence of the photonic band
with $\Neff'<0$ requires the permittivity $\varepsilon_r \gtrsim 50$, which limits the
selection of materials and the operation frequency range. It is well known that a similar
photonic crystal at optical frequencies can be formed e.g. from silicon ($\varepsilon_r
\approx 12$), however its bands of negative refraction will have a high spatial
dispersion and the notion of $\Neff$ cannot be applied for them.

\section{Appendix: Numerical method}
We performed finite-difference time-domain simulations \cite{oskooi2010meep} to obtain
the frequency ($f$)-dependent complex reflection $r(f)$ and transmission coefficients
$t(f)$ of a sample composed of periodically distributed dielectric rods.

Knowing the complex $r(f)$ and $t(f)$ along with the sample thickness $d$, we may use the
classical algorithm to retrieve the effective parameters \cite{smith2002determination}:
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm eff} = \frac{\pm \arccos\left(\frac{1 - r^2+t^2}{2 t}\right) + 2\pi \cdot m}{k
\cdot d}, \quad Z_{\rm eff}~= \pm \sqrt{\frac{(1+r)^2 - t^2}{(1-r)^2 - t^2}} \label{eq_Z}
\end{equation}
where $k = 2\pi f/c$ is the wave vector in vacuum and $c$ is the speed of light.

The well-known complication of this approach is that the arccosine and square root are
ambiguous functions, yielding multiple solutions with different branches (indexed by an
integer $m$) and signs. We deal with a passive medium, consequently we impose
Im$(\Neff)>0$ and Re$(\Zeff)>0$. The correct branch of Re$(\Neff)$ can be in general
determined at low frequencies where the various branches yielded by the arccos function
are well separated. To facilitate processing of the results, we implemented a procedure
that ensures the continuity of effective parameters as a function of frequency: this
continuity is required by Kramers-Kronig relations for arbitrarily small losses
introduced in the system. The important point consists in identifying the branch cuts of
arccosine in the complex plane Fig.\ \ref{fg_arccos}. If, by increasing the frequency,
the arccos argument, $v = (1 - r^2+t^2)/(2 t)$, 
%TODO fix the variable name in the plots!
passes through the right branch cut [i.e.
for $v= u+i 0$ where $u>1$], the real part of arccos$(v)$ touches zero, whereas the
imaginary part is non-zero and changes its sign. The continuity is restored if, from this
frequency on, one reverses the sign of the arccos term. The situation is slightly more
complicated at the left branch cut [i.e. for $v = u+i 0$ with $u<-1$], where the
imaginary part of arccos$(v)$ experiences again a step-like change of the sign and the
real part reaches the value of $\pi$. The continuity is then restored upon a sign
reversal accompanied by a branch index change ($m\rightarrow m\pm 1$). A correct
reconstruction of the arccosine therefore only requires to compute the integer-valued
branch $m(f)$ along with the sign, both being functions of frequency. The sign of the
square root function is again chosen such than $Z$ is a continuous function of frequency.

\end{figure}

It is also known that the reflectance phase depends on the surface termination for
noncontinuous materials. In the cases where the wavelength of the radiation in the
material is much larger than the unit cell dimensions this ambiguity becomes small. A
useful control of the effective sample properties can be made by changing the thickness
of the sample (number of unit cells along the wave vector). We have chosen a symmetric
geometry where the dielectric rod is positioned in the center of a square unit cell and
the total thickness of the sample is an integer multiple of the unit cell size. In this
geometry the retrieved effective parameters of our structure depend only negligibly on
the number of unit cells that we put in the $z$-direction.
