\section{Electrodynamics of continuous media} 
\subsection{Electromagnetic wave in vacuum} % FIXME
\paragraph{Maxwell equations}  %{{{
In the realm of classical physics, the electromagnetic phenomena are governed by the \textit{Maxwell equations} in the following form.
We assume here that no free charges and no sources of currents are present: 
\begin{equation} \nabla \cdot  \D = 0, \label{eq_me1}\end{equation}  
\begin{equation} \nabla \cdot  \B = 0, \label{eq_me2}\end{equation}  
\begin{equation} \nabla \times \E = -\frac{\partial \B} {\partial t}, \label{eq_me3}\end{equation}  
\begin{equation} \nabla \times \HH =  \frac{\partial \D} {\partial t}, \label{eq_me4}\end{equation}  
where the $\E$ and $\HH$ are the electric and magnetic vector fields, and $\D$ and $\B$ are the electric and magnetic displacements,
 respectively. These two pairs of field and displacement are related in a similar way as a force is related to the deformation. %% TODO Simovski2007 regards the current J as force, and E as the deformation!
 The \textit{constitutive relations} depend on the properties of the medium the wave propagates in, and in vacuum they take the simplest possible form:
\begin{equation}		\D = \varepsilon_0	\E, \quad\quad\quad						\B = \mu_0			\HH,				 \label{eq_ce}\end{equation}
the $\varepsilon_0 \approx 8.85\cdot10^{-12}$ F/m being the \textit{vacuum permittivity} and $\mu_0 = 4\pi \cdot 10^{-7} \approx 1.25\cdot10^{-6}$ H/m being the \textit{vacuum permeability}. 
Pages \pageref{starttext}--\pageref{endtext} of this thesis will be concerned with computation, interpretation, and experimental verification of the Eq. (\ref{eq_me1}--\ref{eq_me4}) solutions for specific choices of constitutive equations.
%}}}
\paragraph{Wave equation in vacuum} %{{{
\label{starttext}
The pair of first-order differential equations (\ref{eq_me3}, \ref{eq_me4}) can be converted to a single second-order differential equation. To this end, we apply an extra curl operator $\nabla\times$ from the left, and substituting from one equation into the another, we accumulate two curl operators on the left hand side and two derivatives on the right hand side: 
\begin{equation} \nabla\times (\nabla\times \E) = \nabla\times \left(- \frac{\partial \B} {\partial t}\right) = -\mu_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left(\nabla\times \HH\right) 
= -\mu_0 \frac{\partial^{2} \D}{\partial t^{2}} = -\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^{2} \E}{\partial t^{2}}.  \label{eq_elim}\end{equation}
Using the vector calculus identity
\begin{equation} \nabla\times (\nabla\times \E) \equiv \nabla (\nabla \cdot \E) - \nabla^2 \E, \label{eq_rotrot}\end{equation}
we obtain the \textit{wave equation} for the electric field in vacuum: 
\begin{equation}  \nabla (\nabla \cdot \E) - \nabla^2 \E = -\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^{2} \E}{\partial t^{2}}.  \label{eq_wave}\end{equation}
%Note this holds for each component of electric field independently. -- NOT: the divergence is not independent of other components
Starting with Eq. (\ref{eq_me4}) instead of (\ref{eq_me3}), the same result could also be easily obtained for the magnetic field $\HH$.

\paragraph{Plane wave and sign convention} %{{{
The solutions of the linear wave equation (\ref{eq_wave}) can be decomposed as a sum of \textit{harmonic plane waves}, where \textit{harmonic} means that the amplitude depends on the time $t$ as a harmonic function (e.g. $\sin(t)$). As a \textit{plane wave} we denote such a spatial shape of the fields, that is a function of a single  scalar parameter $\kk\cdot\rr$. Assuming the wave propagates with nonzero velocity, also the spatial dependence on  $\kk\cdot\rr$ must be harmonic, and therefore 

Any other complicated shape of the fields can be decomposed into a linear superposition of more such waves and treated separately \cite{jackson1962book}. 

%Linear electrodynamics is often treated with the 
The electromagnetic field will described as a complex exponential, i.e. as a superposition of two waves differing by a mere quarter-period phase shift, one defining the real part, one the imaginary part of the field. In comparison with the intuitive description of a plane wave in terms of a cosine (or sine) function, the complex notation formally simplifies some mathematical operations, e.g. it allows to easily identify the \textit{phase of a wave as} the exponent, when multiplied by $\ii$.

%% TODO add figure: plane wave
Without loss of generality, we define the electric field as a function of time $t$ and position in space $\rr$, corresponding to a plane wave in the complex notation:
\begin{equation} \E(t, \rr) := \E_0\, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} \label{eq_pw}\end{equation}
The plane wave is fully characterised by its \textit{amplitude vector} $\E_0$, \textit{angular frequency} $\omega$ and \textit{wave vector} $\kk$. Note that no restrictions were put to the amplitude vector $\E_0$ so far, thus Eq. (\ref{eq_pw}) can describe both \textit{transverse} wave of any polarization, with $\E_0 \perp \kk$, and \textit{longitudinal wave} with $\E_0 || \kk$.

An important note shall be made on the sign convention for the complex wave. 
We use the `engineering' convention of time dependence: $e^{+\ii \omega t}$, but this is only due to the author's feeling that it is more natural when the wave phase grows in time. 
It is used in  roughly a half of the literature (e.g. \cite[p. 9]{engheta2006book}, \cite[pp. 21, 99]{krowne2007book}, \cite[chap. 1-4, 6, 9, 10]{eleftheriades2005book}).  In the remaining half, (e.g. \cite[chap. 5, 7, 8]{eleftheriades2005book}), \cite{jackson1962book}, \cite{veselago1968}, \cite{born1999book}, \cite[p. 5]{noginov2011book}), the opposite, `optical', convention is used with time dependence of $e^{-\ii \omega t}$. The choice of $e^{+\ii\omega t}$ or $e^{-\ii\omega t}$ determines the sign of imaginary part in virtually all complex quantities discussed in this thesis, but with correct interpretation it makes no difference in the physical conclusions as it is only a formal simplification.
In the real world, observable fields do not have any imaginary component so the real part of the result has to be taken. 

In the $e^{+\ii\omega t}$ convention, many parameters of a passive (lossy) system are restricted to have \textit{negative imaginary part}.  An additional complication arises from that a part of the authors using $e^{+\ii\omega t}$ convention wish to represent the imaginary part as \textit{positive}, and they define complex quantities as, e.g., $\varepsilon = \varepsilon' - \ii \varepsilon''$, % TODO verify if this is e.g. "Wallen2011-Anti-resonant response of ..."
thus in their case $\varepsilon''\equiv -\text{Im}(\varepsilon)$. Thorough the thesis, we however represent the real and imaginary parts naturally as $\varepsilon := \varepsilon' + \ii \varepsilon'' $.

\paragraph{Dispersion relations in vacuum} %{{{
Only some combinations of ($\E_0, \omega, \kk$) provide a physical solution of the wave equation (\ref{eq_wave}). In vacuum, the allowed solutions can be obtained by first substituting the differential operators by their equivalents for a particular plane wave: %TODO explain
\begin{equation} \nabla \rightarrow -\ii\kk, \quad\quad\quad 
\frac{\partial} {\partial t} \rightarrow \ii\omega, \label{eq_difftok}\end{equation}
so the wave equation (\ref{eq_wave}) can be modified the following way:
$$					\nabla (\nabla \cdot \E) - \nabla^2 \E				  =	-\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^{2} \E}{\partial t^{2}},  $$
$$				 -\ii\kk (-\ii\kk \cdot \E)  - (-\ii\kk \cdot -\ii\kk) \E = -\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 (\ii\omega)^2 \E, $$
$$   - \kk (\kk \cdot \E)      +          k^2 \E            = +\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \omega^{2} \E,  $$
\begin{equation}  T\E :=  -\frac{\kk (\kk \cdot \E)}{k^2} + \E            = \frac{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \omega^{2}}{k^2} \E.  \label{eq_wavek}\end{equation}
The linear operation $T$ of the left hand side can be geometrically interpreted as taking the transverse component of the field $\E$, that is, perpendicular to the wavevector $\kk$. Rewriting it explicitly, we define the \textit{wave-plane projection tensor} that will be useful in the following chapters, too:
\begin{equation} T = \frac{1}{k^2} 
\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 
	k_y^2+k_z^2  	& -k_x k_y 		& -k_x k_z \\ 
	-k_y k_x 		& k_x^2+k_z^2	& -k_y k_z \\ 
	-k_z k_x 		& -k_z k_y		& k_x^2+k_y^2
	\end{array} \right) 
\text{ or equivalently, }
T_{ij} = - \frac{k_i k_j}{k^2} + \delta_{ij} .  \label{eq_transverse}\end{equation}

where we defined the \textit{speed of light} $c := \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}$. The corresponding solution is plot in Fig. \ref{fg_dcvac}, independent of the orientation of the wavevector $\kk$.

\subsection{Local response of media to the electromagnetic field} \label{loc_response_of_media}
\paragraph{Local response definition} \label{subsection_local_resp} %{{{
In the whole chapter, we expect the medium properties to be time-invariant, linear, and homogeneous (i.e. independent of time, field amplitude and position in space, respectively). 
In this section, we focus on the special case when the medium response in point $\rr$ is not influenced by the electric field in any other point $\brho \neq \rr$. The medium is then said to be \textit{local}. 
For most media found in nature, this approximation is very close to reality and thus numerous electrodynamics textbooks tend to omit the nonlocal effects. 
However using this local theory to a wave propagating through periodic structures has a priori no justification and may lead to completely wrong results. The local theory presented here will serve as a basis for the nonlocal theory developed in following chapters.
% Applying the more familiar local electrodynamics to these structures is a mistake common to many papers. While the local theory is mathematically consistent, it predicts unusual spectral shapes and does not allow their further physical interpretation.

When an electric field $\E$ is applied, the medium responds by a change of the electric displacement $\D$ in a way that is characteristic for it. 
The immediate response of vacuum from the right side of the constitutive equations (\ref{eq_ce}) remains unchanged, but the response of the matter adds a new term called \textit{electric polarisation}. The polarisation is not instantaneous, so it is generally expressed as a convolution of the \textit{electric susceptibility} $\chi_e$ with the values of electric field in the previous time $\tau$:
\begin{equation} \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E(t,\rr) + \varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^{t}\chi_e(t-\tau)\, \E(\tau,\rr)\,\mbox{d}\tau. \label{eq_loc_chi_convol}\end{equation}
Assume that a harmonic plane wave propagates through the medium, so $\E(t, \rr) := \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr}$, as given by Eq. (\ref{eq_pw}). This can be inserted in the above equation:
\begin{equation} \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} + \varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^{t} \chi_e(t-\tau) \, \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega \tau - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} \,\mbox{d}\tau. \label{eq_chi_convol_harm}\end{equation}
Substituting $T:=t-\tau$, the exponent can be separated into two parts: one of which factors out of the integral, and the remaining part that turns the convolution into a temporal Fourier transform of the medium response:
$$				 \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} + \varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^{0} \chi_e(T) \, \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega (t - T) - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} \,\mbox{d}T,$$
$$				 \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} + \varepsilon_0 \left( \int_{-\infty}^{0} \chi_e(T)  \, e^{-\ii\omega T}\,\mbox{d}T  \right) \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr}.$$
%% NOTE that the Fourier transform is never subject to the sign change, cf. \ref{eq_kkF}
This is nothing but an application of the convolution theorem: convolution in time domain is equivalent to multiplication the in frequency domain.  %% FIXME normalisation by 2pi?
Consequently we may introduce the local \textit{relative permittivity} $\epsrl(\omega)$ as a function of frequency. It is a property of the medium that determines how strong it develops the electric displacement $\D$ in response to a harmonic wave. From Eq. (\ref{eq_ce}) it is clear that in vacuum,  $\epsrl = 1$.
\begin{equation}  \epsrl(\omega) = \left.\frac{\D(t,\rr)}{\varepsilon_0 \E(t,\rr)} \right|_{\E(t, \rr) := 1 + \chi_e(\omega) = \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr}} = 1 + \int_{-\infty}^{0} e^{-\ii\omega T} \,\chi_e(T) \,\mbox{d}T \label{eq_eps_loc}\end{equation}

\paragraph{Response of a harmonic oscillator} \label{chap_lorentzmedia} %{{{
\begin{figure}[t] \caption{\textbf{a)} Illustration of how a simplified medium may respond to an electric field impulse in the shape of Dirac delta function  $E(t) = \delta(t)$. The response is composed from an instantaneous part from vacuum, $\delta(t)$, and from a delayed ringdown of one damped harmonic oscillator, described by $\chi_e(t) := 2\pi \sin(2\pi t)\,e^{-x/2}$; \textbf{b)} The corresponding local permittivity $\epsrl(\omega)$, computed by Fourier transform of the response. Note that the imaginary part of permittivity is negative due to that the material is lossy (absorbs energy) and that the $e^{\ii\omega t}$ convention is used.} \label{fg_oscillator_spectrum} \centering 
	\includegraphics[width=17cm]{img/oscillator_spectrum.pdf}
\end{figure}
The response function $\chi_e(T, \mathbf{R})$ of usual media is composed of different phenomena.  Each of them may react on different time scales, and thus the medium response usually has a relatively complicated shape in the time domain.  However, to a reasonable degree of approximation, each of the contributions can be treated separately, as is demonstrated in the following.

Linear physical systems with an inertial mass, friction force and a restoring force are known as \textit{damped harmonic oscillators}.  This theory applies well to the electrons elastically bound to an atomic nucleus, as well as to the atoms elastically bound to their equilibrium position in the lattice. The molecular rotation can also be modelled as an (possibly overdamped) harmonic oscillator. Even the free electrons in conductive media can fit into the theory of harmonic oscillator provided the restoring force is set to nearly zero. The response of a harmonic oscillator is easy to describe both in time domain and frequency domain, even without the explicit use of the Fourier transform from Eq. (\ref{eq_eps_loc}). The harmonic oscillator model thus becomes a convenient starting point to approximate the response of materials.

A damped harmonic oscillator is described by a second-order differential equation:
\begin{equation} \alpha \frac{\partial^{2} x(t)}{\partial t^{2}} + \beta\frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t} + \zeta x(t) = f(t). \label{eq_harm_osc}\end{equation}
Provided the driving term on the right hand side  is harmonic $f(t) = e^{+\ii \omega t}$, the system response is also a harmonic function, $x(t) = \chi(\omega) e^{+\ii \omega t}$. The differential equation (\ref{eq_harm_osc}) can be easily solved to show that the complex amplitude of the driven oscillations, $\chi(\omega)$, depends on the angular frequency and on the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\zeta$ in the following way:
\begin{equation} \chi(\omega) \equiv \frac{x(t)}{f(t)} = \frac{1}{\zeta-\alpha\omega^{2} + \ii\omega\beta}  = \frac{\alpha^{-1}}{\frac{\zeta}{\alpha}-\omega^{2} + \ii\omega\frac{\beta}{\alpha}}. \label{eq_harm_osc_result}\end{equation}
The physical meaning of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\zeta$ is of little importance in this text, but without loss of generality the result of Eq. (\ref{eq_harm_osc_result}) can be rewritten into
\begin{equation} \chi(\omega) = \frac{F}{\omega_0^{2}-\omega^{2} + \ii\omega\gamma}, \label{eq_harm_osc_rewritten}\end{equation}
where the physical interpretation of the three (real and positive) parameters is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item{$\omega_0 = \sqrt{\zeta/\alpha}$ is the angular \textit{frequency of resonance}, at which the response is pure imaginary and usually its modulus $|\chi(\omega=\omega_0)|$ is near its maximum.} 
 \item{$\gamma = \zeta/\alpha$ is the \textit{damping rate}. In time domain, it determines the time constant of exponential amplitude decay. In frequency domain, it is roughly proportional to the resonance width. } 
 \item{$F = \alpha^{-1}$ is the \textit{oscillator strength}, determining the amplitude of the response function.}
 \end{itemize}


\paragraph{Permittivity of Lorentz media} Within the approximation of relatively weak fields, the oscillators act independently of each other.
The response of usual media in frequency domain can thus be decomposed with acceptable precision into a sum of $M$ independent harmonic oscillators, each $m$-th oscillator having the resonance angular frequency $\omega_{0m}$, damping rate $\gamma_m$ and strength $F_m$.
The permittivity function of the material is a solution of the differential equation of a damped harmonic oscillator, driven by a harmonic source:
\begin{equation} \epsrl(\omega) = 1 + \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{F_m}{\omega_{0m}^2 - \omega^2 + \ii\omega\gamma_m} \label{eq_lorentz_eps}\end{equation} %% TODO fix sign; TODO what about eps0 before summation?
Advancing from the general formulation in Eq. (\ref{eq_eps_loc}) to the Lorentz oscillator model in Eq. (\ref{eq_lorentz_eps}) is of great importance for theoretical interpretation of the material response, and it has also become a framework for description of periodic structures even in the presence of spatial dispersion.  %% clumsy - remove this sentence?
An example of the time- and frequency-domain response of a medium with one harmonic oscillator in is Fig. \ref{fg_oscillator_spectrum}.
% It is also the way how one communicates the material definition to the numerical simulation software, as described later (in Chap. \ref{chap_fdtd}). 
% TODO decide whether we use exp(i omega t)     -> leads to negative eps''

One can see that each oscillator increases the real part of permittivity, but in the high frequency limit the contribution of the oscillator vanishes. This can be intuitively understood as that at low frequencies $\omega \ll \omega_0$, the system reacts fast enough to simultaneously follow the driving force, whereas at high frequencies  $\omega \gg \omega_0$, the system does not follow the driving force at all.
The contribution of one oscillator to the low-frequency permittivity $\Delta\epsrl(0)$, is inversely proportional to the oscillator restoring force, which links it to the inverse square of the resonance frequency:
\begin{equation} \Delta \epsrl'(\omega\rightarrow0) = \frac{F}{\omega_0^{2}}.  \label{eq_delta_eps} \end{equation}

A more detailed treatment of the theory of the dielectric function $\epsrl(\omega)$ may be found in many textbooks, e.g. \cite[p. 454]{klingshirn2007semiconductor}, \cite{dresselhaus1966optical}. 

We will return to the Lorentz oscillator model also in the Chapter \ref{def_of_mat}, where the shows to be essential for realistic definition of materials for accurate numerical FDTD simulations. The chapter also describes in more detail how the overdamped molecular rotation and the unbound motion of free charges can be easily represented using correct parameters of an oscillator.
%}}}
\paragraph{Permeability of Lorentz media}  %{{{ 
In a manner very similar to the above derivation of the local permittivity, the \textit{local permeability} can be introduced by means of a response of the medium to the magnetic field:
\begin{equation} \murl(\omega) = 1 + \chi_m(\omega) = \left.\frac{\B(t,\rr)}{\mu_0\HH(t,\rr)} \right|_{\HH(t, \rr) := \HH_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr}} = 1 + \int_{-\infty}^{0} e^{-\ii\omega T} \,\chi_m(T) \,\mbox{d}T, \label{eq_mu_loc}\end{equation}
where $\chi_m(T)$ is the \textit{magnetic susceptibility of medium} and $\HH_0$ is the amplitude of the magnetic field. This obviously results in an expression for the local permeability in the frequency domain:
\begin{equation} \murl(\omega) = 1 + \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{F_m}{\omega_{0m}^2 - \omega^2 + i\omega\gamma_m}, \label{eq_lorentz_mu}\end{equation} %% TODO fix sign; TODO what about eps0 before summation?
where formally the same notation was used as in  Eq. (\ref{eq_lorentz_eps}): $\omega_{0m}$, $\gamma_m$ and $F_m$ are the magnetic oscillator's angular frequency, damping frequency and strength. Unlike the electric response, most ordinary media have either almost no response to the magnetic field % todo CITE
or their response is limited to low frequencies.

%}}}
\paragraph{Kramers-Kronig relations in local media}%{{{
Causality prevents any medium from reacting to the future electric (or magnetic) field, so the integration in Eq. (\ref{eq_loc_chi_convol}) goes up to the current time only, $\tau \in (-\infty, t)$. The response of the medium to a real-valued field must moreover be also real, no matter that the computations are often done with complex field amplitude [Eq. (\ref{eq_pw})] for the sake of convenience. 

Thus, the basic physical laws impose relatively strict constraints to the time-domain response function $f(t)$, which translate into another constraints for the possible shape of the response in frequency domain $F(\omega)$. The intuitive physical derivation is based on the fact that any time-domain response function can be trivially separated into its odd and even parts as 
, as shown in Fig. \ref{fg_kk}.

\begin{equation} F_{odd}(\omega) + F_{even}(\omega) = F(\omega), \text{ where } F_{odd}(\omega) = F''(\omega) \text{ and } F_{even}(\omega) = F'(\omega).  \label{eq_kkFodd}\end{equation}
At the same time, $f_{even}(t)$ and $f_{odd}(t)$ are related to each other by having the opposite sign for $t<0$ and the same sign for $t>0$, that is 
\begin{equation} f_{even}(t) = \mbox{sign}(t)\,f_{odd}(t). \label{eq_kkfeven}\end{equation}

\subsection{Dispersion relations in local Drude-Lorentz media} \label{disp_rel_local_media}
\paragraph{Lower and upper polariton branches of transverse waves}  % TODO%{{{
Returning to the derivation of dispersion relations, we start with modifying the constitutive relation (\ref{eq_ce}) to a plane wave propagating in a medium:
\begin{equation}		\D := \varepsilon_0\epsrl(\omega)	\E, \quad\quad\quad						\B := \mu_0\mu_r(\omega)		\HH,				 \label{eq_ce2}\end{equation}
with the relative permittivity $\epsrl(\omega)$ and permeability $\mu_r(\omega)$ being two dimensionless functions of frequency, defined in Eq. (\ref{eq_lorentz_eps}, \ref{eq_lorentz_mu}). 
The wave equation (\ref{eq_wavek}) then changes to
\begin{equation}  T\E =  -\frac{\kk (\kk \cdot \E)}{k^2} + \E            = \varepsilon_0 \mu_0  \epsrl(\omega) \murl(\omega) \, \frac{ \omega^{2}}{k^2} \E.  \label{eq_wavek_disp}\end{equation}
which, in the isotropic case, results in the dispersion curve for the transverse electromagnetic wave 
\begin{equation} k(\omega) = \sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0} \sqrt{\epsrl(\omega) \mu_{r}(\omega)}\;\omega = \sqrt{\epsrl(\omega) \mu_{r}(\omega)}\; \frac{\omega}{c}, \label{eq_dispeq_loc}\end{equation}
with the added frequency-dispersive term responsible for the deviation of Fig. \ref{fg_dcsimpleel} from the original straight light line in Fig. \ref{fg_dcvac}. 





In the simplest example of a single electric resonance with negligible losses, as in Fig. \ref{fg_dcsimpleel}, the curve is divided into two separate branches. The \textit{lower polariton branch} is below the resonance frequency $\omega_0$ and is characterized by the Lorentz oscillator being in phase with the electric field. Above $\omega_0$, the dipoles of the Lorentz oscillator can no more follow the electric field and are opposite to it, thus the response of the medium is negative. With further increase of the frequency, the permittivity crosses zero at the frequency $\omega_{\text{L}}$. %, > \omega_0 which allows the transverse wave to propagate. 
where the \textit{upper polariton branch} starts. In case of a Lorentz oscillator unaffected by the presence of others, the difference $\omega_{\text{L}} - \omega_0$ can be computed from the magnitude of the oscillator (using the Lydanne-Sachs-Teller relation) \cite{klingshirn2007semiconductor}.

The same behaviour is observed for a single resonance in the permeability $\mu_r(\omega)$, and will be typical also for the spectra of resonances of macroscopic structures described later.

Note that the formation of upper and lower polariton branches can be reinterpreted\cite{landau1984electrodynamics} using the theory of coupled oscillators as the result of \textit{anticrossing} between the oscillator at the frequency $\omega_0$ (forming a horizontal line) and the photon branch (forming a straight growing light-line).

When losses are present, the lower and upper polariton branches are connected by a smooth line of \textit{anomalous} dispersion and very high losses.  % TODO \ref{fg_dispersion_polariton}

\paragraph{Longitudinal waves in dispersive media} %{{{
The wave equation in local dispersive media (\ref{eq_wavek_disp})

also allows the existence of longitudinal waves with electric field parallel to the wave vector $\E || \kk$. It was shown earlier that there is no solution for longitudinal waves in vacuum except for a static homogeneous field.

\begin{figure}[t] \caption{Influence of a single resonance in the real part of relative permittivity $\epsrl'(\omega)$ (magenta curve in the left panel) to the shape of dispersion curves in the right panel (green curve, computed using Eq.

If a local medium is assumed, and the wavenumber $k$ is nonzero, such waves can have a solution with nonzero $\E$ when $\epsrl(\omega)' = 0$, or with nonzero $\HH$ when $\mu_r(\omega)' = 0$. Therefore, the corresponding dispersion curve for a longitudinal wave is a horizontal line at $\omega = \omega_{\text{L}}$, independent of $k$. This would be equivalent to a standing oscillation that maintains the spatial amplitude envelope that was originally excited. 

Different physical phenomena can lead to $\epsrl(\omega)' = 0$, some of which introduce relatively low losses at the corresponding $\omega_{\text{L}}$; namely lattice vibrations in nonconductive crystals or electrons in inductive media (like metals and dilute plasma). 

At the interface of two media with negative and positive permittivity, another type of waves can be excited with an intermediate frequency $\omega < \omega_{\text{L}}$ that can not propagate in either of the bulk medium. The dispersion curve of such waves is not flat, allowing them to propagate along the interface. Depending on the mechanism, they are known as  \textit{surface plasmons} or \textit{surface phonon-polaritons} \cite[p. 87]{klingshirn2007semiconductor}, respectively. Accordingly, \textit{surface magnons} should be observed at interfaces where $\mu$ changes its sign.
% Are there surface magnons?

\paragraph{Anisotropy of permittivity} \label{par_anisotropy} %{{{
It shall be noted here that permittivity $\epsrl$ was introduced as a scalar, assuming that the vector of electric field $\E$ and electric induction $\D$ are always of the same orientation:
\begin{equation} \D = \varepsilon_0 \epsrl(\omega) \E \equiv \varepsilon_0  
	\left(\begin{array}{ccc}

\end{equation}
In some media of lower rotational symmetry (such as many crystals, or liquids under static electric field), the medium response depends on the electric field direction. At the beginning of the chapter, however, we assumed the fields are relatively weak, and we imposed the requirement of \textit{linearity} of the medium. Whatever the linear relation of $\D := \mathcal{L}(\E)$
is, it must obey the rule
$$\D_1 + \D_2 = \mathcal{L}(\E_1) + \mathcal{L}(\E_2) = \mathcal{L}(\E_1 + \E_2)$$
for any vectors $\E_1, \E_2$. Such a relation can be fully described by a \textit{tensor of permittivity} % TODO cite 
\begin{equation} \D = \varepsilon_0 \epsrl(\omega) \E \equiv \varepsilon_0

Elaborate discussion on all possible forms of this tensor and their physical interpretation can be found e.g. in \cite[pp. 678--686]{born1999book}. An analogous treatment can be applied to the magnetic permeability, though it is less often needed.

where the wave-plane projection tensor $T$, dependent on the wavevector $\kk$, was already defined in Eq. (\ref{eq_transverse}).

For simplicity, we assume here that the relative permeability $\murl = 1$; the extension to other cases is possible, too. %% TODO Do epsilon and mu commute, if they are both tensors??
A solution of Eq. \ref{eq_wavek} can exist with nonzero $\E$ if and only if the determinant of the set of three linear equations is zero:

The search for dispersion curves in an anisotropic medium is thus transformed into finding zeroes of this function of four scalar variables, $k_x$, $k_y$, $k_z$ and $\omega$.
In the most general case, it can be solved by means of numerical algebra software. 

\todo{verify}
For a given frequency $\omega$, rigorous solution of Eq. \ref{eq_dispdet} in local media gives in fact three solutions, of which two are for different polarisations of a transverse wave, and the third is for the longitudinal wave. The two transverse solutions give identical wave vector (are degenerate) if the medium is isotropic, or if $\kk$ points along the optical axis.

\paragraph{Isofrequency contours}  %{{{
%A resonance in local permittivity (or permeability) creates two polariton branches -- thus the dispersion curves can not be expressed as one simple function $\omega(k)$ of the wavevector $k$. It would then appear adequate to treat dispersion curves as a function of frequency, $k(\omega)$, but as is shown below in the presence of nonlocal response, neither $k$ is necessarily a simple function of $\omega$. Also 
It is often important to describe the dispersion curves also for different wave angles, which is the best accomplished by plotting the  %% todo ...real part of ...
frequency $\omega$ as the function of \textit{wave vector} $\kk$. In three dimensions, this would require mapping a function of three independent variables, $\omega(\kk) = \omega(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. However, in most cases the projection of two selected components of $\kk$ is sufficient to understand all relevant phenomena, and naturally it is much easier to visualize.

Such a plot is known as \textit{isofrequency contours} (IFC), or also \textit{equifrequency contours} (EFC), and allows for intuitive geometrical analysis of various phenomena such as light refraction, beam walk-off, total internal reflection etc. 
The relation between a dispersion curve for one photonic branch and the corresponding isofrequency contours in an isotropic medium is shown in Fig. \ref{fg_ifc_dc}.

Its limitation is, however, that IFC plots do not show the imaginary part and thus are applicable to plot the dispersion in media with no or negligible losses only.  
Each photonic branch also has to be plotted in a separate plot to prevent the contours from overlapping (see the right panel of Fig. \ref{fg_dcsimpleel}). 
Moreover, in every single photonic branch, Eq. \ref{eq_dispdet} yields two solutions for two possible polarisations of transverse waves \cite[p. 46]{klingshirn2007semiconductor}. The IFCs for these solutions are generally different in anisotropic media, but we always restrict the discussion only one polarisation in the following figures  for simplicity. % \todo{discuss?

Isofrequency contours are valuable for graphical prediction of wave refraction on interface of two media \cite[p. 118]{shalaev2010book}. Starting, e.g., in the isotropic medium in Fig. \ref{fg_ifc}a, the wavevectors are known for given frequencies (as three coloured arrows).
The component of wave vector parallel to the interface (chosen as $k_x$ here and indicated by the vertical dashed lines) must be maintained upon refraction. This rule can be intuitively deduced from the continuity of the wave phase at the interface, as well as from the Noether theorem applied to the infinite translational symmetry of the interface. Transferring the vertical dashed lines to IFC plot of another medium and finding the intersections with an IFC of the corresponding frequency, one can find the new wavevector. 
In Fig. \ref{fg_ifc}, we provide examples of IFCs for one isotropic and two anisotropic media.

%}}}
\paragraph{Index of refraction and its applicability}  %{{{
With the background of the theory developed above, the notion of the \textit{index of refraction} $N$ can be properly introduced and discussed. 
In the most strict sense, the index of refraction is defined only for \textit{isotropic} media. Then it is equivalent to the ratio of the wavenumber $k(\omega) \equiv |\kk|$ to the wavenumber in vacuum at the same frequency: 
\begin{equation} N(\omega) := k(\omega) \, \frac{c}{\omega} \equiv \sqrt{\epsrl(\omega)\murl(\omega)}, \label{eq_}\end{equation}
as directly follows from Eq. (\ref{eq_dispeq_loc}).

Starting with a harmonic plane wave with the frequency $\omega$ and the wave vector $\kk^{(1)}$ refracting at an interface of two isotropic media, the projection of $\kk$ to the interface is given as 
$$ k_x = k^{(1)}\,\sin \alpha^{(1)}, $$
where $\alpha^{(1)}$ is the angle between the wavevector in the first medium $\kk^{(1)}$ and the  normal to the interface. In the second medium, a similar relation must apply, however the wavenumber $k^{(2)}$ may be different and as a result, the angle in the second medium is
\begin{equation} \alpha^{(2)} = \arcsin\left( \frac{k^{(1)}}{k^{(2)}} \,\sin \alpha^{(1)} \right) = \arcsin\left( \frac{N_1}{N_2} \,\sin \alpha^{(1)} \right), \label{eq_snell}\end{equation}
which is known as the \textit{Snell} (or also \textit{Snell-Descartes}) law.

The majority of (effective) media discussed in this thesis are however more or less anisotropic, and somewhat surprisingly, the notion of \textit{index of refraction} $N$ seems to be widely used for them in the literature anyway. The author thus feels there is a need for a conscientious extension of $N$ for anisotropic cases, too. An extremely loose definition of $N$ could be based on computing the ratio $N(\omega, \kk) := kc/\omega$  for any medium. This can be formally done, but then the wavenumber $k$ would also depend on the direction $\alpha$, and the Snell law in Eq. (\ref{eq_snell}) would become an implicit equation, losing its original purpose of making the computation explicit and notably simple.

The author proposes instead to restrict the term \textit{index of refraction} to all cases where IFCs are perpendicular to $\kk$. This covers not only all isotropic media, but also those cases when the waves propagate close the optical axis of any anisotropic media. An example of an anisotropic medium with its optical axis oriented in such a way that the refraction can be computed using Snell law provided the $k_x$ component is shared with \ref{fg_ifc}a, is shown in Fig. \ref{fg_ifc}c. For small deviations from this angle, where the IFC can be approximated by an osculating circle, 
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial k}{\partial \alpha} \ll k,\label{eq_osculating}\end{equation}
the Snell law still gives a correct prediction of the refraction angle. 

We will however show in the following that the prediction of \textit{beam} propagation is more complicated, being sensitive to the \textit{curvature of IFC}.

\paragraph{Phase velocity and group velocity}  %{{{  todo near single resonance
So far only the propagation and refraction of an infinite, single-frequency wave was discussed, and it was shown that it is determined by the shape of IFC at the given frequency. %% todo rewrite to more precise

If the wave is temporally modulated, its envelope in time is given as a complex vector function $\E_0(t)$ replacing the constant vector $\E_0$ in Eq. \ref{eq_pw}. This can be equivalently expressed in the frequency domain as the wave being formed by superposition of multiple frequency components, with respective amplitudes given by the Fourier transform of $\E_0(t)$. The position of the envelope in time is determined by their \textit{mutual phase difference}, not by the absolute wave phase. 

A similar argument can be made regarding the spatial modulation of the wave. Any wave shape other than the infinite plane wave is a superposition of waves with different wavevectors, and the direction of propagation of the spatial envelope is given by mutual phase difference of the constituent waves. % TODO rewrite-unclear

The velocity vector of the envelope propagation, denoted as the \textit{group velocity} $\mathbf{v_g}$, can be found as the gradient of frequency by the wavevector: %% TODO cite
\begin{equation} \mathbf{v_g} := \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial \kk} \equiv 
\left(\begin{array}{c} 
	\partial \omega/\partial k_x \\ 
	\partial \omega/\partial k_y \\ 
	\partial \omega/\partial k_z \\ 
	\end{array} \right)
 \label{eq_vg}\end{equation}
In the IFC plot, the group velocity can be visually found as directing always perpendicular to the IFC, with its magnitude being proportional to the density of the IFCs.

If the group velocity is different from the phase velocity, the envelope $\E_0(t)$ is maintained over time, but it continuously shifts against the underlying wave. Thus the actual temporal shape of $\E(t)$ changes upon passing through a dispersive medium.
On the contrary, in vacuum or media with negligible dispersion, each frequency component of the wave acquires an additional phase strictly proportional to its frequency. Then the group velocity coincides with the phase velocity: 
$$\hspace{3cm}\mathbf{v_g} = \kk \omega / k^2 \hspace{3cm} \text{(in nondispersive isotropic media)}.$$
%The orientation of $\vg$ and $\kk$ is usually the same, but later it will be shown that it can be otherwise, with peculiar physical consequences.

Usually in spectral regions near a resonance, also the quadratic or even higher terms in the Taylor expansion of the $\omega(\kk)$ dependence shall be taken into account. This effect is known as the \textit{group velocity dispersion} as it is equivalent to the group velocity $\vg(\kk)$ being dependent on the wavevector (or, if reformulated, on frequency). It results in temporal distortion of the wave envelope $\E_0(t)$.  %% TODO ... and what about distortion in space?

\paragraph{Propagation of a beam in anisotropic media}  %{{{  
The refraction of a beam is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fg_ifc2} by means of three slightly different wavevectors it is composed of. For simplicity, a monochromatic wave was used, so brown, black and violet were chosen for the three example wavevectors to prevent confusion with the rainbow-like frequency color map used in Fig. \ref{fg_ifc}. 

In the first plot, \ref{fg_ifc2}a, the case of an isotropic medium is illustrated. Upon refraction into a general anisotropic medium in Fig. \ref{fg_ifc2}b, each component must maintain its wavevector projection to the interface, thus the wavevectors spread in their direction. The resulting beam propagates along the group velocity that is different from the central wavevector; % The components of the resulting beam are   is narrower and does not propagate 
this is also known as the spatial \textit{walk-off}.

Fig. \ref{fg_ifc2}c shows again the special case of anisotropic medium, where the wave propagates near the optical axis, and thus where the Snell law can still be used to determine the refraction of a plane wave, based the generalized notion of the index of refraction.
However, there is a pitfall if one tries to apply the Snell law for prediction of how the beam will refract. The problem originates from the differential nature of the group velocity definition in Eq. (\ref{eq_vg}). 
%While the magnitude of the wavevector changes only negligibly, with the square of a 
While the phase velocity of a monochromatic wave at the frequency $\omega_0$ does not appreciably change upon a small deviation of the angle $\alpha$ from the optical axis  [c.f.  Eq. (\ref{eq_osculating})], the group velocity direction does, because it has a nonzero linear component in its dependence on the wavevector:
$$ \frac{\partial \vg(\kk)}{\partial \alpha} \neq 0.$$
As a result, the group velocity in anisotropic media is always much more sensitive to the angle than the phase velocity, and Snell law does not predict it correctly. It can be regarded as a spatially-dependent manifestation of the group velocity dispersion.

In Fig. \ref{fg_ifc2}d, an extreme case of spatial walk-off is shown on the example of a \textit{hyperbolic} medium with different signs of the permittivity along different axes. %% TODO study Belov2003 and possibly correct this if hyperbolas are wrong
 The normal to its IFC is nearly perpendicular to the wavevector, and accordingly, the beam refracts in opposite angle with regards to the incident wave. The $k_x$ component of the wave vector is however still maintained.

%If the amplitude and phase of the wave is not  temporal shape of a wave can be composed as a superposition of different frequency components with certain amplitude and phase. Similarly, any spatial shape of a beam can be composed of infinite waves of different wavevectors. The isofrequency contours, and their dependence on frequency, allow to determine how the temporal and spatial envelope will propagate. 
%Assuming a short pulse for simplicity

\paragraph{The sign of the phase and group velocities}  %{{{
So far, in the discussion of refraction both in Fig. \ref{fg_ifc} and \ref{fg_ifc2}, the solution of the vertical wave vector component $k_y$ pointing downwards was always selected without providing justification. In fact, both upwards and downwards pointing wave vector provide valid solution. The reason is that in the first medium represented by the leftmost plots (Fig. \ref{fg_ifc}a and \ref{fg_ifc2}a), the incident wave was propagating downwards to the interface, and it was assumed that also the refracted wave will propagate downwards, from the interface.

A more complicated case occurs when the wave vector $\kk$ and group velocity $\vg$ point in opposite direction (or more generally, when they have an opposite projection on the normal to the interface).  This manifests as IFC radius \textit{decreasing} with frequency growing, as shown in  Fig. \ref{fg_ifcnr}.
Such a case can indeed occur in natural or artificial media, as described in more detail below.

In the isotropic media, or the media where the wave vector points in direction close to the optical axis, the Snell law is still applicable, and we then speak of \textit{negative index of refraction}.  The refraction between an ordinary medium and two examples of negative-index media are plotted in Fig. \ref{fg_ifcnr}.
It should be noted that the negative-index media are necessarily dispersive. Therefore, the refraction of temporally short pulses disperses different frequencies into different angles, as can be found from the wavevectors at different frequencies in Fig. \ref{fg_ifcnr}b,c.

\subsection{Nonlocal response} % TODO
\paragraph{Definition of nonlocal media}%{{{
%TODO: spatial dispersion describes one specific sort of nonlocal behaviour that exists in homogeneous infinite media only
The previous two chapters that concerned local media can be generalized into the theory of \textit{nonlocal} (or, \textit{spatially dispersive}) media that follows.

The downsides of the spatial-dispersive model of media is that it is more complicated, leading e.g. to an implicit dispersion equation. Its great advantage is however that it provides a necessary level of generality for the description of periodic structures discussed below. 
Some phenomena observed in the frequency spectrum are in fact consequences of the spatial dispersion, such as the Doppler broadening of resonance lines in gases \cite[p. 359]{landau1984electrodynamics}. More precisely, these phenomena are primarily dependent on the wave vector $\kk$, and their expression by means of the temporal spectrum is a mere approximation based on that the dispersion curve usually defines a simple relation between  frequency and wave vector.  %% TODO rewrite?

In this section such a more general class of media is discussed, where the medium response explicitly depends on the history of $\E(\tau, \brho)$ in previous time $\tau < t$ and in all surrounding points $\brho$, and therefore is described by a spatio-temporal convolution:
\begin{equation} \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E(t,\rr) + \varepsilon_0\int_{V} \int_{-\infty}^{t} \chi_e(t-\tau, \rr-\brho) \, \E(\tau,\brho) \,\mbox{d}\tau \,\mbox{d}^3\brho. \label{eq_chi_convol_nonloc}\end{equation}
In a very similar manner as in the local theory above, we assume a plane wave $\E(t, \rr) := \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr}$ propagates through the medium. This is without loss of generality, thanks to that it is possible to express any wave as a superposition of monochromatic plane waves.
\begin{equation} \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} + \varepsilon_0\int_{V} \int_{-\infty}^{t} \chi_e(t-\tau, \rr-\brho) \, \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega \tau - \ii\kk\cdot\brho} \,\mbox{d}\tau \,\mbox{d}^3\brho. \label{eq_chi_convol_harm_nonloc}\end{equation}
After two  substitutions, $T:=t-\tau$, $\mathbf{R}:=\rr-\brho$, the exponent can again be separated into the original plane wave (which factors out), and a spatio-temporal Fourier transform of the medium response:
$$				 \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} + \varepsilon_0\int_{V} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \chi_e(T, \mathbf{R}) \, \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega (t - T) - \ii\kk\cdot(\rr - \mathbf{R})} \,\mbox{d}T \,\mbox{d}^3\brho,$$
$$				 \D(t,\rr) = \varepsilon_0 \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr} + \varepsilon_0\left( \int_{V} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \chi_e(T, \mathbf{R})  \, e^{-\ii\omega T + \ii\kk\cdot \mathbf{R}}\,\mbox{d}T \,\mbox{d}^3 \mathbf{R} \right) \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr}.$$
The response of the medium to the electric field of any harmonic plane wave can now be expressed as a function of frequency $\omega$ and wave vector $\kk$. It is defined as the ratio between the electric displacement and the electric field:
\begin{equation} \epsrn(\omega, \kk) = \left.\frac{\D(t,\rr)}{\varepsilon_0 \E(t,\rr)} \right|_{\E(t, \rr) := \E_0 \, e^{\ii\omega t - \ii\kk\cdot\rr}}  = 1 + \int_{V} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \chi_e(T, \mathbf{R}) \,e^{-\ii\omega T + \ii\kk\cdot \mathbf{R}} \,\mbox{d}T \,\mbox{d}^3\mathbf{R} \label{eq_eps_nonloc}\end{equation}
Converting the problem from the spatio-temporal domain into the wavenumber-frequency domain allows to express the relation between $\D$ and $\E$ by the \textit{permittivity} function $\epsrn(\omega, \kk)$ and completely avoid the convolution from Eq. (\ref{eq_chi_convol_harm_nonloc}). Note that both the response function $\chi_e$ and the permittivity $\epsrn$ %% TODO make it \varepsilon_r
may be either scalar functions, or rank-2 tensor functions; the latter case accounts for possible anisotropy of the medium.
% , and convolution in space is equivalent to multiplication  in the reciprocal space

The terms of \textit{nonlocality} and of \textit{spatial dispersion} are used interchangeably in the literature. The difference seems to be related to the way one thinks about the medium -- while \textit{nonlocality} is obviously related to the description in the real space [cf. Eq. (\ref{eq_chi_convol_nonloc})], \textit{spatial dispersion} derives from that the response is not a constant function in the reciprocal $\kk$-space. In the author's view, the term \textit{spatial dispersion} is therefore of slightly narrower meaning, as it implies that a plane wave of a defined wavevector is considered in an infinite medium.

%}}}
\paragraph{Power expansion of the medium parameters} %{{{
Assuming the dependence of the medium permittivity $\epsrn(\omega,\kk)$ or permeability $\murn(\omega,\kk)$ is a function varying slowly with $\kk$, we can express them in general as power series \cite[p. 367]{landau1984electrodynamics}:
\begin{equation} 
\left.  \begin{array}{c}
\epsrn(\omega,\kk) = 1 + \chi_e(\omega) + \ii \gamma_{\text{e}}(\omega) \kk + [\alpha_{\text{e}}(\omega) \kk] \kk + \ldots, \medskip  \\
\murn(\omega,\kk) = 1 + \chi_m(\omega) + \ii \gamma_{\text{m}}(\omega) \kk + [\alpha_{\text{m}}(\omega) \kk] \kk + \ldots, 
\end{array} \quad \right\} \quad \text{(in any media)}
\label{eq_epsmusd1}\end{equation}
where $\chi_{e,m}(\omega)$ are tensors of the second rank, $\gamma_{e,m}(\omega)$ of the third rank, $\alpha_{e,m}(\omega)$ of the fourth rank, and similarly for possible higher orders of expansion. After the corresponding number of matrix multiplication with $\kk$, they all yield rank-2 tensors that add up to form the tensor of permittivity or permeability.
%In this customary symmetric approximation of local media, both the electric permittivity and permeability in Eq. (\ref{eq_eps_loc}) are composed of two terms, one caused by the immediate response of vacuum, and another by the response of matter. In nonlocal media, both functions depend on the wavevector $\kk$, making the solution of Maxwell equations more complicated.

Note the response function for a local medium can be formally derived from its nonlocal formulation by replacing the spatial dependence by a Dirac delta function: %% TODO fix the sencence - it is in fact incorrect
\begin{equation} \chi_e(t-\tau, \rr-\brho) = \delta^{3}(\rr-\brho) \; \chi_e(t-\tau), \label{eq_loc_chi}\end{equation}
which allows to simplify Eq. (\ref{eq_chi_convol_nonloc}) so that in local media only the temporal convolution has to be computed. Then the higher order terms including $\gamma_{e,m}$ and $\alpha_{e,m}$ in Eqs. (\ref{eq_epsmusd1}) vanish:
\begin{equation} 
\left.  \begin{array}{c}
\epsrn(\omega,\kk) = 1 + \chi_e(\omega) = \epsrl(\omega), \medskip \\
\murn(\omega,\kk) = 1 + \chi_m(\omega) = \murl(\omega). 
\end{array} \quad \right\} \quad \text{(in local media)}
\label{eq_epsmusd2}\end{equation}

%}}}
\paragraph{Magnetic effects can be described by nonlocal permittivity} %{{{
Here, we will follow the approach of Landau and Lifshitz (see \cite{landau1984electrodynamics}, and also \cite{krowne2007book_agran, agranovich2006spatial}) to show that the magnetic response of any medium can be fully expressed by a certain form of permittivity dependence on $\kk$. This leads to introducing new \textit{Landau-Lifshitz} permittivity and permittivity, which are, in general, different from those used in the more customary symmetric model:
$$\epsLL(\omega, \kk) \not\equiv \epsrn(\omega, \kk),\quad\quad\quad 1 = \muLL(\omega, \kk) \not\equiv \murn(\omega, \kk).$$
The Maxwell equations (\ref{eq_me1}-\ref{eq_me4}) however still hold when these new parameters are substituted for the original ones.
The advantage is that the relative magnetic permeability is defined as a mere constant of the magnetic response of vacuum $\muLL(\omega, \kk) := 1$, thus reducing the complexity of the computation compared to the symmetric spatial-dispersive model. %% [as in Eq. (\ref{eq_ce})]

%}}}
\paragraph{Local medium in the Landau-Lifshitz model} %{{{
For simplicity we assume %% ... or "start with" TODO extend also to nonlocal ones
the medium is local, and described by $\epsrl(\omega)$ and $\murl(\omega)$.
The new spatial-dispersive permittivity $\epsLL(\omega, \kk)$ then consists of the 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{the component caused by the local electric response of matter,} 
 \item{a new component fully accounting for the \textit{magnetic} response of matter, thanks to a particular shape of its spatial dispersion.}
\end{enumerate}
This model may be easily extended later to accept nonlocal constitutive parameters.

Repeating the Maxwell equation (\ref{eq_me4}) that links the magnetic field $\HH$ with the electric induction $\D$, 
\begin{equation} \nabla \times \HH =  \frac{\partial \D} {\partial t}, \tag{\ref{eq_me4} \again} \end{equation}
it is clear that if one defines new pair of vector fields
\begin{equation} \HHsd = \HH + \frac{\partial\mathbf{X}}{\partial t}, \label{eq_HHsd}\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \Dsd  = \D  + \nabla\times \mathbf{X}, \label{eq_Dsd}\end{equation}
then Eq. (\ref{eq_me4}) maintains exactly the same form with the new fields, for any differentiable vector field $\mathbf{X}$:
\begin{equation} \nabla \times \HHsd = \nabla \times \HH + \left(\nabla\times \frac{\partial\mathbf{X}}{\partial t}\right) = \frac{\partial \D}{\partial t}+ \frac{\partial(\nabla\times \mathbf{X})}{\partial t} =  \frac{\partial \Dsd} {\partial t}, \label{eq_me4sd} \end{equation}
because for well behaved functions the temporal and spatial derivatives commute.

%% TODO how this transform is denoted?
With the freedom of choice of $\mathbf{X}$, we impose the above mentioned requirement that whole magnetic response of the matter is expressed by the constitutive equation for permittivity. Therefore in spatial-dispersive theory, the constitutive equation %% TODO reference some text from above pargraphs
for magnetic induction is defined the same as in vacuum:
\begin{equation} \mu_0 \HHsd := \mu_0 \murl(\omega) \HH = \B. \label{eq_mu_sd}\end{equation}
When this equation is rearranged into the form similar to \ref{eq_HHsd}, we obtain a prescription for sought $\mathbf{X}$: 
$$ \HHsd = \HH + (\murl(\omega) -1)\HH = \HH + \underbrace{\left(\frac{\murl(\omega)-1}{\mu_0\murl(\omega)}\right)\B}_{=:\,\partial\mathbf{X}/\partial t}$$
Without loss of generality, we again restrict the discussion to a plane wave (\ref{eq_pw}), thus the time derivative equals to multiplication by $\ii\omega$.
\begin{equation} \mathbf{X} = \frac{1}{\ii\omega}\left(\frac{\murl(\omega)-1}{\mu_0\murl(\omega)}\right)\B = \frac{1}{\ii\omega\mu_0}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\murl(\omega)}\right)\B. \label{eq_Xsd}\end{equation}
The new \textit{Landau-Lifshitz} electric displacement $\Dsd$ that also accounts for magnetic phenomena is obtained by substitution of Eq. (\ref{eq_Xsd}) into Eq. (\ref{eq_Dsd}):
\begin{equation} \Dsd := \D - \ii\kk\times \mathbf{X} =  \D - \ii  \frac{1}{\ii\omega\mu_0}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\murl(\omega)}\right) \kk\times \B  \label{eq_Dsd2}\end{equation}
By means of the other Maxwell equation (\ref{eq_me3}), the magnetic induction $\B$ can be substituted by $\kk\times\E / \omega$ to obtain an expression that contains the electric quantities only.
\begin{equation} \Dsd = \D - \frac{1}{\omega^2 \mu_0}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\murl(\omega)}\right) \kk\times(\kk\times \E).  \label{eq_Dsd3}\end{equation} 
Double vector multiplication on the right hand side can be identified with the wave-plane projection tensor $T$, c.f. Eqs. (\ref{eq_rotrot}, \ref{eq_transverse}):
\begin{equation} \Dsd = \D + \frac{k^2}{\omega^2 \mu_0}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\murl(\omega)}\right) \, T \E,  \label{eq_Dsd3}\end{equation} 

%}}}
\paragraph{Tensor form of the Landau-Lifshitz permittivity of local isotropic media}%{{{
%Continuing in the derivation outlined in , 
From Eq. (\ref{eq_Dsd3}) we can derive the tensor form of spatial-dispersive permittivity $\epsLL(\omega,\kk)$:
\begin{equation} 
\left.  \begin{array}{c}
\epsLL(\omega,\kk) = 1 \,+\, \chi_e(\omega) \;\;+\;\; \frac{k^2}{\omega^2 \mu_0}\left(1 - \frac{1}{\murl(\omega)}\right) \, T, \medskip \\
\muLL(\omega,\kk) = 1, 
\end{array} \quad \right\} \quad \text{(in local media)}
\label{eq_epsmusd3} \end{equation} 
where 
\begin{equation} T = \frac{1}{k^2} 
\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 
	k_y^2+k_z^2		& -k_x k_y		& -k_x k_z \\ 
	-k_y k_x		& k_x^2+k_z^2	& -k_y k_z \\ 
	-k_z k_x		& -k_z k_y		& k_x^2+k_y^2
	\end{array} \right) 
\text{ or equivalently, }
T_{ij} = - \frac{k_i k_j}{k^2} + \delta_{ij} . \tag{\ref{eq_transverse} \again} \end{equation}

Let us note that the classical approach using symmetric parameters $\epsrl(\omega,\kk),\murl(\omega,\kk)$, and the Landau-Lifshitz approach of gathering all medium-related effects in the permittivity $\epsLL(\omega,\kk)$ are only two examples of all possible transformations of medium parameters that keep the Maxwell equations unchanged. If needed, it is formally possible to use any other arrangement, which may moreover be frequency dependent, leading to a physically realistic pair of parameters with uncommon properties \cite{skaar2014}.

\end{figure}

Both the dispersion curves and the isofrequency contours predicted by the classical and Landau-Lifshitz representations of the constitutive parameters should be identical. This is illustrated by Fig. \ref{fg_dcll} on three examples - of a medium with electric resonance, a magnetic resonance and both resonances overlapping. The left column shows the \textit{local} permittivity $\epsrl(\omega)$ and permeability $\murl(\omega)$.

The right column additionally shows the Landau-Lifshitz permittivity $\epsLL(\omega, k)$ as a colour map with blue tone for negative values and red for positive ones. The thin black line overlay connects all points where the dispersion equation holds. %% , $\epsLL(\omega, k) \,\omega^2 / k^2 = 1$. TODO this is more complicated, as epsLL is a tensor - find which equation to refer to
As a confirmation of the compatibility of the Landau-Lifshitz model with the classical one, the original green dispersion curve from Fig. \ref{fg_dcsimpleel} is retained, which was computed using the classical approach based on the Eq. (\ref{eq_dispeq_loc}). It can thus be seen that both models always predict exactly the same dispersion.

For a local isotropic medium with a single electric resonance in Fig. \ref{fg_dcll}a, the curves plotted are identical to Fig. \ref{fg_dcsimpleel}. The Landau-Lifshitz permittivity $\epsLL(\omega, k)$ follows a resonance curve in frequency, but is independent of the wavenumber $k$ (as long as the medium is local). With frequency increasing, the lower polariton branch bends towards higher $k$, as $\epsLL(\omega, k)$ increases towards the resonance at $\omega_0$, then a band of frequency follows where and no solution of the wave equation %% TODO REF
exists due to $\epsLL(\omega, k)$ being negative, and finally the upper polariton branch starts when $\epsLL(\omega, k)$ crosses zero and becomes positive again.

A local medium with a single \textit{magnetic} resonance, Fig. \ref{fg_dcll}b, is predicted by the symmetric model to exhibit a similar dispersion curves. At the right panel of Fig. \ref{fg_dcll}b, the magnetic resonance is represented by the
%%% TODO add Eq. 2.52 repeated with underbrace
contribution that grows proportionally with $k^2$, and its maximum magnitude is located at the frequency $\omega_{mp}$ where $\murl(\omega_{mp}) = 0$. This shape of $\epsLL(\omega, k)$ causes the lower polariton branch to bend and approach a horizontal asymptote, which is again separated by a band of no allowed wave from the upper polariton branch, starting at $\omega_{mp}$.
$\epsLL(\omega, k)$

Finally, in Fig. \ref{fg_dcll}c, both resonances are combined. The main difference from Fig. \ref{fg_dcll}a occurs in the frequency range where originally $\epsLL(\omega, k) < 0$ and no wave could propagate. However, the magnetic resonance increases $\epsLL(\omega, k)$ by a term proportional to $k^2$, and consequently a new photonic branch is formed with $\mathrm{d}\omega/\mathrm{d}k < 0$, that is, with opposite group and phase velocities. Thus, the medium behaves as described in Figs. \ref{fg_ifcnr}b and \ref{fg_ifcnrk}b.
 %The left panel of Fig. \ref{fg_dcll}a is therefore identical to the previous one. Its left panel is identical to that shown in Fig. \ref{fg_dcsimpleel}, as the medium can still be fully described by

\subsection{Impedance and amplitudes of the refraction and reflection}
\paragraph{The interface of two local media}\todo{connect somehow with the rest of theory?} %{{{ 
So far, only the phase-related phenomena were discussed: based on the local or nonlocal response of the medium, the dependence of the dispersion curves and IFCs was computed. Geometrical arguments then were used to infer the angle of refraction at the interface of two media, showing e.g. that a positive or negative refraction may occur, that the beam may refract in different direction than the wave vector, and that in some cases the notion of index of refraction can be used to simplify the problem based on the Snell law.

The conservation of wave phase at the interface is, however, not the only constraint to the refraction/reflection problem: Assuming the surface current and surface charge are zero and that the  medium is local, the \textit{parallel} component of the fields $\E$, $\HH$ with regards to the interface must be continuous. Additionally, the \textit{perpendicular} component of the displacements, $\D$ and $\B$, is continuous, too. This can be deduced from the integral formulation of Maxwell equations [Eq.  (\ref{eq_me1}--\ref{eq_me4})], 

The reflection and refraction (i.e. transmission) coefficients are derived in many textbooks \cite[p. 38]{born1999book} with different levels of generalisation. In the particular case where wave perpendicularly impinging an interface of two isotropic local media, described by their impedances $Z_1, Z_2$, respectively, the (complex) reflection $r$ and transmission $t$ are
\begin{equation} r = \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2+Z_1}, \quad t = \frac{2 Z_2}{Z_2 + Z_1}, \label{eq_reflection}\end{equation}
with the impedances
$Z_{12} = \sqrt{\frac{{\murl}_{12}}{{\epsrl}_{12}}}$.
\add{This is in fact similar to the reflection on a one-dimensional transmission line, as known from microwave engineering.}

\section{Electromagnetic waves in periodic structures}
\subsection{Bloch theorem}
%In a given time the wave in a periodic medium takes on the form of Bloch wave (\ref{eq_bloch}): 
 %$\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}Kz} \cdot \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r})$, i.e. it is a product of a harmonic \textit{envelope} and a cell-periodic \textit{mode}. Computing the dispersion curves involves computing the envelope wavenumber $K = K(f)$ for each frequency $f$ in the desired spectrum. The information about the mode $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r})$ is not used and instead the metamaterial cell is treated as if it was a homogeneous medium -- therefore this procedure is also called \textit{homogenisation}.

\paragraph{The Bloch-Floquet theorem}%{{{
% TODO define periodicity

The important Bloch-Floquet theorem states that while the wave in periodic medium does not have to be periodic anymore, it is a product of two periodic functions:
\begin{equation} \E(t, \rr) = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} Kz - 2\pi \mathrm{i} f t} \cdot \mathbf{u}(\rr), \text{ where } \mathbf{u}(\rr) = \mathbf{u}(\rr+a\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{u}(\rr+2a\mathbf{z}) = \ldots, \label{eq_bloch}\end{equation} 
The $\mathbf{u}(\rr)$ function has the same periodicity as the structure. It is generally a complex vector function so it not only alters the direction and magnitude of $\E$ (or  $\HH$), but can also introduce a \textit{phase modulation} of the wave in each unit cell. Note that the capital $\KK$ is used to distinguish the wave vector of the Bloch wave envelope from the wave vector $\kk$ in free space. Note this theorem does not determine how the shape of $\mathbf{u}(\rr)$ nor the direction and magnitude of $\KK$, it only states they do exist.

\paragraph{Virtual periodicity and ambiguity of the mode function}%{{{
\add{
The simplest "structure" to be started with is surely the empty vacuum with homogeneous $\varepsilon := 1$ and $\mu := 1$. One particularly simple solution of the Maxwell equations in vacuum is the planar wave propagating along the $z$-axis, defined by Eq. (\ref{eq_pw2}).
Let us now introduce virtual periodicity, requiring that the vacuum properties are invariant under discrete translation by an arbitrary length $a$ along the $z$-axis, which naturally holds. The important Bloch-Floquet theorem states that while the wave in periodic medium does not have to be periodic anymore, it is a product of two periodic functions:

\begin{equation} f = \frac{ck}{2\pi \cdot n} = \frac{ck}{2\pi \cdot \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu}}. \label{eq_dispersionold}\end{equation}
The constant $n = \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu}$ connecting the frequency and wavenumber is the index of refraction.

\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{Folded and unfolded dispersion curves for free space and photonic crystal. The phase difference over an unit cell can be expressed either by the wavenumber $K$ (unfolded plots \textbf{a, b} above), or it can be partially absorbed into the periodic mode function $\mathbf{u}(\rr)$ (folded plots \textbf{c, d} below) } \label{fg_phc} \centering  %% TODO write caption; complement the text to match

When the wavelength is less than double cell spacing, or equivalently when $2\pi c /K < 2 a$, the unit cells can scatter the forward propagating wave into the backward direction and vice versa. In an infinite periodic structure the energy transfer must be conserved, so the forward and backward waves must be of the same amplitude. (The equilibrium of forward and backward wave amplitudes may, however, differ in some cases even in in infinite periodic structure. One example is when the constituent materials lose time-reversal symmetry due to static magnetic field.) We assume this also in this example with virtual periodicity. The \textit{Bloch wave} (\ref{eq_bloch}) is a product of two functions, and it gives one degree of freedom to select which part of (\ref{eq_bloch}) expresses the phase shift across one unit cell. Two different conventions are used in the literature.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{In the \textit{unfolded} plot, the phase shift is expressed entirely by the envelope $\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}Kz}$. One can always find a line coming from the front side of a unit cell to its back side, along which the mode function does not change its phase significantly $\mathbf{u(\mathbf{r})}$. In other words, the volume of the unit cell is not divided by any \textit{nodal plane} in the real part of electric field  $\mathbf{u(\mathbf{r})}$. (However, closed nodal planes within the unit cell may appear due to individual resonances.)

In vacuum, the mode function takes the simplest form, being constant $\mathbf{u(\mathbf{r})} = 1$ at all frequencies. The dispersion relation of vacuum forms a direct line as plot in Fig. \ref{fg_phc}a.} 
 \item{The \textit{folded} plot requires $K/\left(\frac{2\pi}{a}\right) \in (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ and the remaining phase is mostly expressed by the mode function. 
Further savings of space in the plot can be made using the symmetry of the forward and backward waves, so only the positive half for $K/\left(\frac{2\pi}{a}\right) \in (0, \frac{1}{2})$ has to be plot to describe the mode structure.} 
 \end{enumerate}
Although maybe less instructive, usually the \textit{folded} bands are plot in the literature and they are used also in Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}, \ref{fg_rodh} and \ref{fg_erod_radius11} below. The same approach can be used for periodic structures, where the bands are separated by band gaps, cf. Fig. \ref{fg_phc}b and \ref{fg_phc}d.

The studies of periodic electromagnetic structures is generally divided into two classes: the \textit{photonic crystals} and \textit{metamaterials}. These types of structures are formally very similar, as they are composed of 2-D or 3-D periodic array of unit cells, and the qualitative difference can be found only after the interaction with an electromagnetic wave is known. 

%The difference is in the way how the unit cell interacts with the electromagnetic field. 
In the photonic crystal (PhC), at its frequency range of operation, the effective wavelength is similar to the cell spacing and the cells scatter the propagating wave.
The energy of the resonant field is spread relatively evenly over the majority of the unit cell volume, which results in great sensitivity of the PhC behaviour to its periodicity and typically also in a high spatial dispersion. The most prominent phenomenon observed in PhC is the emergence of forbidden photonic bands around resonant frequencies, where the light can not propagate through the structure. 

On the contrary, 
the cells of a metamaterial (MM) are expected to exhibit individual resonances which should not significantly couple to each other. 
At the resonant frequencies in the metamaterials, the majority of the energy of the electromagnetic field is localised in a fraction of the unit cell volume, so that the behaviour of the metamaterial usually has only weak spatial dispersion, if any. This allows one to describe many metamaterials with acceptable precision as a homogeneous medium with a index of refraction $N(f)$, wave impedance $Z(f)$ and related effective permittivity $\varepsilon(f)=N/Z$ and permeability $\mu(f)=NZ$. 

Both types of structures exhibit the most interesting behaviour at their frequencies of resonance, but the different types of resonances define the technology and materials used to build them. The resonances in PhC rely on wave scattering, which can be easily obtained with any ordinary low-permittivity material such as silica or silicon. On the other hand, the resonances 
%but the mentioned difference has profound consequences on the behaviour of the structure.

More detailed investigation shows that the effective-medium approach does not give accurate results when the structure is not infinite \cite{richter1995}, as is often the case. Therefore, a numerical computation using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) or using FDTD has to be used.
