%%% Hole : Conclusion - what to put here?
%% NOTES: What WAS discussed in the thesis and is special:
%  * aims to present an accessible introduction to the electrodynamics of periodic structures. 
%  * historical notes 
% 	(the base line is that many concepts are not as novel as they may appear, and that modern papers
%	often fail to cite the author of the original idea)
%    historical review suggests formal unification of MM and PhC concepts, attempt for clarification of these two terms
%	 ... which is also illustrated by the numerous recent publications on the rod array, which lies at the boundary between MM and PhC
%  * filled the demand for some starting overview of the common structures, in a level of detail and
%    didactic approach that the author was missing in the available literature
%	  sum up all  structures
%	- some of them have Neff<0, but the regions of applicability for eeff nor meff is much more restricted 
%		to regions of |Neff'|~0
%	- some others have well-defined electric and magnetic individual resonances, yet Neff is not applicable when
%		the resonances are close enough in frequency, requiring the use of spatial-dispersive theory
%	- in general, Neff can only be used in isotropic media, or for propagation nearly parallel to the optical axis;
%		a special exception is when approaching a Dirac point of isofrequency contours
%	- (the choice of branch for Neff is unambiguous by our retrieval procedure based on FDTD; yet it deserves
%		proper physical interpretation in some structures)
%  * the Results section has shown that for the idealized lattice of resonant elements, denoted as a Bloch lattice in \ref{simovski2007bloch}, the spectra of effective index of refraction would have a form of alternating photonic bands, with always growing Neff(f), and photonic band gaps, where $Neff'(f)$ follows a Brillouin zone boundary, except for well-defined individual resonances of the electric or magnetic dipole. The results have, nonetheless, also proven that this interpretation is only approximate, due to evanescent inter-cell coupling and the resulting spatial dispersion. In particular, some structures made of metal preclude to use the $Neff'(f)$
%	  
%  * pointed out the fundamental problems: 
%      1) losses in available materials,   \cite{tassin2012comparison}


%      2) excessive spatial dispersion in known structures; i.e. the eff-param spectra often 'stick' to the BZ boundary
%		  without this interpretation, various papers fail to explain the typical "antiresonance" in effective parameters, that seems to cause confusion 
%		  (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201502298/full etc.)
%         stress the importance of taking the spatial dispersion into account; omission thereof is in some case a fundamental misconception, rather 
%			than a mere inaccuracy
%			(papers sometimes claim that negative refraction may not occur at NIR/optical frequencies due to the lack of magnetic activity; however
%			this relies on the local eff. param theory)
%      3) the s-parameter method, although widely used, does not always give correct results for diverse reasons
%		  notice that e.g. 1-D PhC allows to determine Neff, but not eeff,meff, whereas
%		  the electro-magnetic resonator exhibits independent el and mag resonances, but its Neff can not always 
%		  be determined
%  * illustrated the difference of the s-parameter results against supposedly more reliable CDH
%  * provide the simulation environment which facilitates correct computations,  and solves 
%	  1) the artifacts from the near field around the structure being recorded by the monitor planes (--reformulate)
%	  2) by mathematical means, the phase-ambiguity of the retrieved effective index by the s-parameter method 
%  * proposes a novel temporal shape for a wave source in FDTD that yields a flat-top spectrum in a well-defined 
%		interval of frequencies
%  * we developed an original apparatus for accurate sieving
%	 for the fabrication of sieves, we constructed a laser micro-machining setup in the laboratory, 
%	 including an original electrical and software design of the motor controller (published online)
%    and the auto-collimating setup for accurate beam focusing
%  * We validated these FDTD computations against
%     1) the H-bars spectra in the NumMet section
%	  2) the Pendry's and Maslovski's models for f_p
%	  3) the composite spectra of statistical sample of microspheres
%  * express author's opinions on: 
%		1) viability of the notion of "information velocity"   
%		2) local media application and the importance of spatial dispersion on some structures
%		3) questioning the supposed novelty and practical impact of MMs
%		4) that probably no dielectric-only metamaterial can be built for permittivity contrast below 50
%       5) origin of antiresonance observed in effective $\eeff(f)$ or $\meff(f)$, and its persistence in random structures

%+ Kramers-Kronig check of the RodArray spectrum (or some other?)



%% NOTES: What WAS NOT discussed in the thesis -- Things that could be pursued further on the basis of the presented work:
%% * quasicrystals and disorder, 
%  * other (photonic) crystal families than square/cubic
%  * plasmonic nanoparticles (and related MMs at optical frequencies?)
%% * chiral media, bianisotropy, circular dichroism
%			"Further, also the effects of more general properties of the constituent materials could be investigated, but this would require expanding the source code of the FDTD simulation library used (i.e., MEEP). While anisotropy and optical activity would be welcome, the particularly interesting option is gyrotropy, i.e. non-hermitian form of the permittivity or permeability tensors  that breaks time-reversal symmetry. This would open the wide research possibilies of non-reciprocal metamaterial devices."
%    these are "chiral gammadions" MMs etc.
%% * temporal symmetry breaking, 
%% * two-dimensional structures - metasurfaces
%% * structures with nonlinearity or loss,    
%% * tunable structures:		Where appropriate, we also investigated?? how this behaviour depends on some external parameter (such as electric field, temperature or illumination) -- in other words, how the \textit{tunability} of the structure can be achieved.

\section{Metamaterials -- Critique and alternatives}
Many different designs of photonic crystals, and in particular, of metamaterials were proposed in the last decades, part of them being aimed at the terahertz range. %They have been also summed by several books and reviews % TODO refs x5
lacks:

TODO TODO At the end, the author would like to express his concern about the efficiency and practical impact of the metamaterial research in the last years. 
The number of papers related to metamaterials has rocketed in the last decade in almost unprecedented way % todo cite some MM scientometry here

, and 
the hypertrophic number of publications dissolves the concentration of pertinent ideas in almost a homeopatic way.  
Perhaps anybody interested in MM will soon notice there are many papers adding just a quantitative difference to what was already published, often without stating this important fact. This may give a superficial feeling of an exponential gathering of knowledge, but in fact it mostly contributes to the information noise. 
In addition, the MM-related books available are often composed of ordinary papers, unrelated to each other and not covering all necessary theory, thus hardly preparing the reader to study the literature.

%The name of this chapter is borrowed from the same-named book by Ben Munk \cite{Munk2004}. The book presents several objections against MM that seem to be ill-argumented and some of them seem to be also utterly wrong. 
%However, as another point it also touches a really deep problem: 

It is understandable that such a new (or at least newly recognized) scientific field exerts a great pressure to publish as much and as early as possible, which is exacerbated by the objective way of how the contemporary scientific work is evaluated. 
That said, the situation is not as bad as it might seem and the author is also aware of several recent brilliant MM publications that give a deep insight into new physical phenomena.


Another question is the practical benefit of metamaterials for the humankind. 
Compared to the publication boom and its optimistic aims, the metamaterials find their way to applications markedly slowly. The novel phenomena such as cloaking or sub-wavelength imaging are still confined to laboratory demonstrations, usually for structures not much bigger than the wavelength. The research of semiconductors in the first decades did not bring any notable applications, either, but even at that time it had to be clear that semiconductors present a wholly new field of basic material research. On the other hand, the recent progress in the field of metamaterials resembles the applied research: It is mostly a \textit{design} and \textit{optimisation} of already known structures towards some particular behaviour, rather than a search for new fundamental physics. 

Writing these lines, the author is not aware of any readily realized application where a metamaterial would present a significant advantage over classical structure. Will metamaterials ever find their application in any field of technology? And if not, will at least some of the developed theory or methods be useful in the future?

To conclude this pessimistic, but well meant section, the author

%Fundamental issues have to be resolved in the MM and PhC field are
%losses

The TiO$_{2}$ resonators, whose the manufacturing and sieving process, experimental characterisation and numerical computation was extensively discussed in this thesis, can be viewed as an example of such research.
\add{Owing to the homogeneous broadening of the resonator resonance, caused by intrinsic losses of TiO$_{2}$, further sieving appears to lack any purpose. Not only this project broadens the numerous group of technically successful research projects pointed in utterly wrong direction, it also classifies into the lamentable subgroup of effort that could be entirely avoided if open and honest scientific discussion took place about the inherent problems. In this case, particularly, in all related papers it should be openly stated that the dielectric losses of TiO2 prevent building any applicable volume metamaterial, no matter how accurately the resonators are prepared.}

\paragraph{Optimistic notes}
That said, the author does not want the thesis to sound too sceptical about the future of electromagnetic structures. 

\add{
Metamaterials do not bring new physical phenomena on their own, they only force one to conscientiously review the common electrodynamics. There
are no novel phenomena, just a novel task of homogenisation and possibly enew values of constitutive parameters"

The research of Metamaterials is typical by taking a relatively novel phenomenon (wave propagation in periodic structure) and
interpreting it on the basis of a well-developed theory (electrodynamics of homogeneous media). In future, this trend may be opposite --
that is, new theory motivated by the metamaterial research may find its application on other phenomena.
One example may be the theory of strongly hyperbolic media, which turns out to be fundamental for electrodynamics in extremely strong magnetic fields \cite{smolyaninov2011vacuum}.

\section{Outcomes of the thesis}

We presented experimental and theoretical studies of simple periodic structures -- the periodic arrays of dielectric slabs, two orientations of rods, dielectric spheres, metallic wire mesh, as well as a composite of spheres and a mesh. An attempt was made to make an analysis of the modes that are responsible for the photonic bands, illustrating different electromagnetic phenomena and their dependence on a structure parameter. An analytic model for wire medium was proven to match our numerical results.
The prospects for the future work are to broaden this catalogue to other structures in order to enable comparison and deeper physical interpretation of their behaviour. 

% TODO comment on, give links, encourage one to use: The dissertation involved the development of a reliable platform for numerical simulations of photonic structures, based on freely available code. 
A versatile numerical environment for simulations was prepared and tested in the last two years. All computation scripts, containing over 2000 lines of Python code, are open-source and they use freely-redistributable libraries only, which may be useful for the broader scientific community in the future. 
The automated effective parameters retrieval from FDTD is especially suitable for parametric scans. It proves instrumental in optimisation of the structure performance, matching experimental data, as well as studying the tunability.

Broad range of physical phenomena may be included in the simulations. A library of realistic permittivity models is being built that allows to match TDTS experiments with a good accuracy. It is also possible to combine dispersive dielectrics with metals and doped semiconductors. 
 The FDTD method is applicable also to non-periodic, lossy and time-changing structures, while PWEM enables e. g. studies of the magnetooptic phenomena.
All referred numerical methods, FDTD, PWEM and TMM, were tested also to give compatible and plausible results under oblique incidence and both TE/TM polarisations.
