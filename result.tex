The one-dimensional photonic crystal (1-D PhC) has been investigated thoroughly in the previous century and found its major application in dielectric mirrors. It is the simplest representative of periodic structures, since  it exhibits only a subset of different phenomena that can be observed in other periodic structures. This is due to its continuous translational symmetry in the transverse direction that excludes all phenomena with a lower symmetry. 

Most importantly, no \textit{individual resonances} can occur in 1-D PhC; all interaction with the wave happens through partial reflection of the electromagnetic wave on the interfaces of the layers. The only type of the band gap observed is of the Bragg type.

Dispersion curves for two examples of one-dimensional photonic crystals were computed using PWEM and are shown in Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}. 
Its left panel shows the folded dispersion curves for a plane wave propagating in vacuum on which we imposed virtual periodicity. To save space, the dispersion curves were plotted as \textit{folded}, but one can easily imagine how the curve unfolds into a linear dispersion of vacuum, known as the \textit{light line}. No scattering occurs for homogeneous vacuum, thus for any frequency $f$ exists a real wavenumber $k$ corresponding to a propagating wave and there are no band gaps of finite width. 

The right panel, Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}b, is obtained by introducing periodic layers of dielectric with permittivity 12\% and 15\% filling fraction. The dielectric is outlined by thin black lines. Band gaps of nonzero width corespond to frequency ranges where the wave can not propagate through the structure. %TODO The first photonic band gap starts at the frequency, TODO at which exactly half wavelength matches the cell spacing, i.e. when $2\pi / K= a/2$ as is depicted in the subplot \textit{X1} of Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}b. The next band starts at the same wavenumber $K$, but the wave now has higher frequency because in the subplot \textit{X2} of Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}b it is shifted by half its period so that it maximizes the electric field energy that is localized in the areas of lower permittivity. Higher Bragg band gaps are formed by the same mechanism.

\paragraph{Characteristics of Bragg-type band gaps}
The lower and upper edge of the photonic bands are located the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, such as $\mathbf{\Gamma}$ or $\mathbf{X}$, which are equivalent to the wavenumber $K=m\pi/a$ for $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ in the one-dimensional case discussed. Whenever $K$ is in one of these points, the electric and magnetic fields are periodic in space, and can be easily visualized. The side plots of \ref{fg_1dbd} show the shapes of the electric field $E_x$ in the $(y,z)$ plane at respective frequencies of the band edges. To stress the fact that the field is periodic even in the $\mathbf{X}$ point, each of the side plots spans over 2$\times$2 unit cells. 

An important characteristic of each field pattern is the set of all points where the field amplitude remains zero over the evolution of time. Such sets will be denoted as \textit{nodal planes}, or also, more accurately, \textit{nodal surfaces}.

From all pairs of field plots that are connected by a photonic band (i.e. X2-$\Gamma2$, $\Gamma3$-X3 etc.), it can be deduced that one nodal plane dividing the unit cell in perpendicular orientation to the wave vector is always added when the frequency increases from the lower band edge to the upper one. This rule is more general and is satisfied by other structures, too. 

Typical for all Bragg band gaps (i.e. X1-X2, $\Gamma2$-$\Gamma3$, etc. in \ref{fg_1dbd}) is that between the lower and upper edges of each band gap, the phase increase across an unit cell does not change and thus $K$ remains constant, as does the number of the nodal planes. The field does change between these points, however, and the change is in the location of the \textit{nodal planes} such that the upper band-gap edge concentrates the field energy in mostly lower-permittivity regions. 

\paragraph{Bragg and Fabry-Pérot resonances}
The \textit{Bragg condition} for the formation of a band gap in a periodic structure is that an integer number of half waves fits into the unit cell; i.e. that the phase difference $\phi_{1+2}$ of the wave along the unit cell is 
\begin{equation} \phi_{1+2} = d_1 n_1 \frac{\omega}{c} + d_2 n_2 \frac{\omega}{c} = \pi m, \text{ where } m\in \mathbb{Z}. \label{eq_braggcond}\end{equation}
where $d_{1,2}$ are the thicknesses and $n_{1,2}$ are the refractive indices of the two layers.

The width of the band gap grows with the amplitude of the wave scattered from the unit cell. This amplitude however also depends on frequency and, in the case of a lossless dielectric slab, it vanishes whenever an integer number of the half-waves fits into either of the dielectric layers. For comparison with Eq. (\ref{eq_braggcond}), this condition is
\begin{equation} \phi_{1} = d_1 n_1 \frac{\omega}{c} = \pi m \text{\quad or \quad} \phi_{2} = d_2 n_2 \frac{\omega}{c} = \pi m, \text{ where } m\in \mathbb{Z}. \label{eq_fpcond}\end{equation}
Note that unlike the Bragg resonance, this effect can be observed even in a single isolated unit cell; in fact it is the well known \textit{Fabry-Pérot resonance}. 

The vicinity of a Fabry-Pérot resonance influences the position and width the neighbouring band gap, which can be found for different dielectric permittivity of the slab $\epsrl\in\{4,12,20\}$ in Fig. \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_epsilon_comparison}.

A special case can occur when the conditions for both Bragg and Fabry-Pérot resonances are fulfilled simultaneously: a \textit{zero-width band gap} is obtained and two photonic bands are adjacent to each other in the same way as they were in vacuum (c. f. Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}a). An example of a structure that exhibits multiple zero-width band gaps is the 1-D PhC with equal optical thickness of both slabs ($d_1 n_1 = d_2 n_2$), but multiple such points can be found when the dielectric permittivity or the dielectric filling fraction is changed, as depicted in Figs. \ref{fg_slab_eps_scan} and \ref{fg_slab_ff_scan}, respectively. These plots are also the simplest examples of the interplay between the individual resonance contained in the dielectric structure and the overall band-gap structure, a topic that will be discussed later in more detail.

\paragraph{Local effective parameters of a 1-D PhC}
Employing the \textit{s-parameter} method based on FDTD simulation, as described in Chapter \ref{chapter_sparam}, one can obtain the scattering parameters (i.e. complex reflectance and transmittance) of a finite layer of the periodic structure, and eventually retrieve its local effective parameters: the index of refraction $\Neff(f)$, impedance $\Zeff(f)$, permittivity $\eeff(f)$ and permeability $\meff(f)$. The first one is plotted in Fig. \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_epsilon_comparison}c, allowing to clearly identify the Bragg band gaps as regions where $\Neff'$ follows one of the Brillouin zone boundaries and $\Neff'' < 0$.

The question is to what extent the three remaining local parameters, $\Zeff$, $\eeff$ and $\meff$, have any physical meaning. As a generally accepted approach, they will be considered meaningful only for the long wavelength limit, i.e. $K$ close to the $\mathbb{\Gamma}$ where the effects of the spatial dispersion should be negligible. According to Fig. \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_epsilon_comparison}c, this is for frequencies up to 100 or 200 GHz only. At any higher frequency, the retrieved wavenumber $K$ approaches the Brillouin zone boundary, marked by the dash-dotted line, and grows further.


In the low frequency limit of 1-D PhC, it was always observed that
\begin{enumerate}
\item{$\Zeff \approx 1/\Neff$, thus the effective permeability is $\meff = \sqrt{\Neff\Zeff} \approx 1$.} 
\item{The effective permittivity $\eeff$ is the weighted average of the constituent media, which determines the low-frequency limit for the refractive index:
	\begin{equation} \left.\Neff\right|_{K\ll 2\pi/a} =\left. \sqrt{\eeff}\right|_{K\ll 2\pi/a} \approx \sqrt{\frac{d_1 n_1^{2} + d_2 n_2^{2}}{d_1+d_2}} \label{eq_phc_eeff}\end{equation}
	}
\end{enumerate}
Notice in Fig. \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_epsilon_comparison}c that $\Neff$ at higher frequencies converges towards its asymptotic value $\left.\Neff\right|_{K\rightarrow +\infty}$, which differs from the value obtained by Eq. (\ref{eq_phc_eeff}):
\begin{equation} \left.\Neff\right|_{K\rightarrow +\infty} \approx \frac{d_1 n_1 + d_2 n_2}{d_1+d_2} \label{eq_phc_neff}\end{equation}
The difference comes from that in the low-frequency limit, the electromagnetic energy concentration is higher in the areas of higher permittivity, whereas in the high-frequency limit it appears to be distributed evenly.
Note that with the correct branch retrieval procedure, the index of refraction never drops with frequency except for the photonic band gaps. Negative derivative of $\Neff(f)$ would otherwise imply that the group velocity would be higher than the phase velocity \cite{mikki2009electromagnetic}, which was never observed in 1-D PhC.

\section{Wire medium} \label{chap_wiremedium}
\paragraph{High-frequency behaviour}
The structure formed of a regular square lattice of conductive wires exhibits more interesting properties when the electric field is parallel to the wires, and this polarisation will be assumed in the following. The lattice of wires perpendicular to the electric field does not appreciably interact with the electromagnetic wave, until the wire thickness is of similar magnitude to their spacing; such a case is discussed in another Section \ref{section_eot}.

In the high-frequency part of the spectrum above the first photonic band, where more than a half wave fits into the unit cell, the layers of metallic rods can be approximated by thin scattering slabs from the previous section, since the high-frequency interaction of the wave can be described of photonic bands alternating with Bragg band gaps. In contrast with the dielectric PhC described above, no Fabry-Pérot resonances are observed and the scattering strength of the wire layers reduces monotonously with growing frequency.

\begin{figure}[bh] \caption{Amplitude of \textbf{(a)}  reflectance, \textbf{(b)} transmittance \textbf{(c)} effective index of refraction $\Neff$ and \textbf{(d)} effective permittivity $\eeff$ for the array of wires made of gold, depending on the wire radius $\rho_w \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16\}$ $\mu$m with a fixed unit cell size $a = 100$ $\mu$m and grid resolution of 1 $\mu$m. } \label{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_wireradius_scan} \centering \vspace{-3mm}

\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Inductive behaviour at low-frequencies}
At low frequencies, in contrast, the interaction of the conductive wires with the electromagnetic wave becomes very strong and leads to completely different behaviour than that described above. For a frequency range from zero up to the \textit{effective plasma frequency} $f_p$, the array exhibits a band gap where $\Neff$ is pure imaginary and $k'\approx 0$. Therefore, in the low-frequency part of the spectrum, the local effective permittivity $\eeff$ is a physically meaningful quantity and follows the law typical of inductive media:
\begin{equation} \eeff(f) = 1 - \frac{f^{2}}{f_p^{2}}\label{eq_eeff_plasma}\end{equation}
Such a dependence of $\epsrl$ was already used in the Drude model in Eq. (\ref{eq_drude_eps}), and plotted in Fig. \ref{fg_Au_models}. Owing to this similarity to metals or plasma, wire arrays are denoted also as \textit{diluted metal} or \textit{artificial plasma} since 1950s \cite{merkel1973simulation, rotman1962plasma}, or as \textit{metallic delay dielectrics}, owing to the possibility to manipulate the phase and group velocities  \cite[p. 54]{brown1953artificial}.

The physical origin of $\eeff<0$ is different than in continuous media, where it is \textit{kinetic}, i.e., due to the effective mass of electrons. In contrast, the negative effective permittivity in wire arrays is the result of the \textit{self inductance} due to the magnetic field circulating around the conductor. 

Except for optical frequencies, $f_p$ does not substantially depend on the internal plasma frequency of the constituent metal, and such behaviour can be obtained even if wires are thought to be made of a perfect electric conductor (PEC).
The plasma frequency does, however, depend on the geometry described by two parameters, the wire radius $\rho_w$ and the unit cell size $a$. 

\paragraph{Behaviour close to the effective plasma frequency}
The dependence of $f_p$ on the wire radius $\rho_w \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16\}$ $\upmu$m is illustrated by the spectra of reflectance, transmittance, refractive index and effective permittivity in Fig. \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_wireradius_scan}. The effective plasma frequency $f_p$ can be easily determined as the point where $\eeff'(f)$ crosses zero  in the plot \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_wireradius_scan}d. This coincides with the lower edge of the first photonic band in Fig. \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_wireradius_scan}c. 

For the limit $f \rightarrow f_p+$, the phase velocity $c/n = c/\sqrt{\eeff(f)}$ is proportional to $(f-f_p)^{-1/2}$ and thus very high. Conversely, the group velocity $v_g \approx 2\pi \mathrm{d}f/\mathrm{d}k = \mathrm{d}f/\mathrm{d}n$ vanishes, being proportional to $(f-f_p)^{+1/2}$. The product of the phase and group velocities close to $f_p$ thus remains nearly constant $c^2$, which is a phenomenon commonly encountered also near the \textit{cut-off frequency} of metallic waveguides.

Exactly at $f=f_p$, the wire array medium can support the longitudinal oscillations of the charge, oriented parallel to the wires. They bear a close resemblance to plasmons in bulk media \cite{pendry1996extremely}.

Notice that for a single cell, the transition from negative to positive permittivity is not accompanied by any obvious spectral feature on the reflection/transmission plot. Except for the zero frequency, a layer of wires has always nonzero transmittance that increases with frequency. Independent of the wire conductivity, it is not possible to build a 100\% efficient wire polarizer.

\end{figure} \clearpage

\paragraph{Plasma frequency as a function of wire radius and unit cell size}
From Fig.  \ref{fg_Slab_fillfraction015_wireradius_scan}, it can be also deduced that $f_p$ is approximately proportional to the logarithm of $\rho_w$ if $\rho_w \ll a$. This is related to that a thicker wire should have slightly lower self-inductance per unit length. 

The effect of wire spacing $a$ is the opposite; with $a$ growing, the magnetic field has more space to circulate around the wir and $f_p$ reduces. 

Different analytic models were proposed for description of both effects. The early model by Pendry \textit{et al.} from 1996 \cite{pendry1996extremely} works well for thin wires: 
\begin{equation} f_p(\rho_w,a) \approx \sqrt{\frac{c^2}{2\pi \, a^2 \, \ln(\frac{a}{\rho_w})}}. \label{eq_fp_pendry}\end{equation}
Its refinement by Maslovski \textit{et al.} from 2003 \cite{maslovski2002wire} should be valid also for wires with relatively high fill fraction:
\begin{equation} f_p(\rho_w,a) \approx \sqrt{\frac{c^2}{2\pi \, a^2 \, \ln\left(\frac{a^2}{4\rho_w (a-\rho_w)}\right)}} \label{eq_fp_maslovski}\end{equation}

We ran two series of wire array simulations as a simple verification of both the FDTD algorithm against the mentioned analytic models. In the first series plotted in Fig. \ref{fg_omegap_a}a, we kept the wire radius constant $r = 16\,\upmu$m  and changed the wire spacing $a$ (red points). For comparison, we plot in the plasma frequency predicted by both analytic models from Eqs. (\ref{eq_fp_maslovski}, \ref{eq_fp_pendry}) as full and dotted lines, respectively. 

To test the possible error introduced by the FDTD algorithm, we ran the simulation with different resolution - results with fine $1$ $\upmu$m grid are denoted by full circles, results with coarse $4$ $\upmu$m grid with empty squares. Finally we also repeated this plot for thinner wire with $r = 8$ $\upmu$m. %%todo rewrite?

In the second series of simulations plotted in Fig.  \ref{fg_omegap_a}b, we kept the spacing $a = 100\,\upmu$m and changed the wire radius $r$. The analytic model and FDTD simulation give similar results (up to 5 \%) even for wire radii approaching roughly $a/4$. For thicker wires, the analytic model predicts higher plasma frequency than FDTD.  To conclude, the results of the model presented by Maslovski match the FDTD simulation with good accuracy for thin wires (where $r \lesssim a/5$). One possible application of the wire medium is in the construction of negative refractive index metamaterials, where a small negative real value of effective permittivity is desired.%%todo rewrite?

\paragraph{Individual resonances}%{{{
The low-frequency behaviour of the wire array is determined by the distributed inductance of the wires, which introduces negative effective permittivity up to the plasma frequency $f_p$. When the wires are cut in each unit cell, a three-dimensional periodic lattice of antennas is formed. Its important parameters are not only the inductance along each antenna, but also the capacitance across the gap between wires. In an analogy with a series LC (coil-capacitor) circuit, such antennas exhibit \textit{individual resonances} at some nonzero resonant frequency $0<f_r<f_p$. These resonances couple to the electromagnetic field through their electric dipole.

The spectra for the cut-wire structure are depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_CutWires_wireradius1u_cutwidth_comparison} for different cut distances $d_c$. Starting with the thinnest wire of $\rho_w = 2$ $\upmu$m (red curve), we can identify the individual resonance as the point close to  1200 GHz where even a single layer of unit cells reflects full wave amplitude and the transmittance drops to zero. Towards higher or lower frequencies from the resonance, the transmittance is relatively high.

%}}}
\paragraph{Dispersion near an individual resonance}%{{{
Each individual resonance in a periodic structure forms a characteristic shape in the spectrum of effective index of refraction $\Neff(f)$. The following description will therefore be applicable to individual resonances in other resonant structures, as well. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item{At frequencies under the resonance, the electric dipole of the antenna oscillates in phase with the driving field and the resonance contributes the effective index of refraction $\Neff'(f)$. 
The spectrum of a periodic structure with an individual resonance differs from the spectrum of a homogeneous medium that was already described at the Lorentzian resonance curve in Fig. \ref{fg_oscillator_spectrum}b.
At some frequency $f \lesssim f_r$ below the resonance, the index of refraction $\Neff'(f)$ becomes high enough to join the closest Brillouin zone boundary which was above it. From this point up to the resonance frequency $f_r$, $\Neff(f)$ has nonzero imaginary part, and the medium exhibits a band gap.
} 
\item{Exactly at the resonance frequency, the interaction of the dipole with the field changes its sign, since above the resonance, the dipole starts to be oriented opposite to the driving field. 
The real part of the refractive index $\Neff'(f)$ ceases to follow one Brillouin zone and transitions to another Brillouin zone below it. In local media, individual resonances appears to be the only occasions for $\Neff'(f)$ to transition downwards.

The imaginary part of the refractive index, $\Neff''(f)$, is required by the Kramers-Kronig relations to exhibit a sharp peak at the resonance frequency, which is superposed over the broader background stemming from the band gap (see Fig. \ref{fg_CutWires_wireradius1u_cutwidth_comparison}c). 

The spectral width of the transition and peak is inversely proportional to the quality of the resonance. Whenever the structure is built from realistic materials with nonzero losses and its spatial dispersion can be neglected, $\Neff(f)$ is a continuous complex function.
} 
\item{The band gap continues up to some frequency $f > f_r$, where another photonic band begins between the same pair of Brillouin zones.  
} 
\end{enumerate}

The most important observation is that the resonance curve of $\Neff(f)$ in periodic structures is constrained between the closest two Brillouin zone boundaries, which can be understood as the "floor" and "ceiling" for the dispersion curve. Apparently a single individual resonance can not shift the transmittance phase by more than $\pi$ per each layer of unit cells. It can therefore introduce a band of imaginary $\Neff$, but for $\Neff$ to reach negative values, two resonances must be combined.

The impact of the individual resonances on the effective parameters $\eeff(f)$ and $\meff(f)$ will be discussed in the later section focused on the dielectric resonators. % TODO verify that I have done this

%}}}
\paragraph{Effects of the cut distance $d_c$}%{{{
An increase of the cut distance $d_c$ clearly leads to increase of the resonance frequency $f_c$. The reason is twofold: for a cut width small relative to the unit cell size, $d_c\ll a$, it is mostly due to reduced capacitive coupling between the cut wires; for cut width comparable or greater than the unit cell size, $d_c \gtrsim a$, reduction of the cut-wire inductance plays major role.

Both the individual and Bragg-type resonances can be identified in the plot for different $d_c$ in Fig. \ref{fg_CutWires_wireradius1u_cutwidth_comparison}c. When $d_c \sim 16$  $\upmu$m, the individual resonance shifts above 1.5 THz and exchanges its order with the Bragg band gap. 
For $d_c \gtrsim 32$  $\upmu$m on, the individual resonances are similar to those for a $d_c\sim 2$ $\upmu$m, but are shifted by one Brillouin zone up.

The dependence of the resonance frequency $f_c$ on the wire radius, Fig. \ref{fg_CutWires_wirecut2um_wireradiusscan}, is somewhat more complicated: For thin enough wires in the $a=100$ $\upmu$m unit cell, the resonance frequency decreases with growing $\rho_w$, since the inter-wire capacity increases. 
For high enough $\rho_w$ a competing mechanism prevails; $f_c(\rho_w)$ then starts growing as a result of reduction of the wire self-inductance.

While the change of the cut-wire radius $\rho_w$ relatively weakly reflects in the resonance frequency, its major impact is in the \textit{strength} of the individual resonance. Thick wires lead to stronger reflection out of resonances, which also translates into a wider band gap in Fig. \ref{fg_CutWires_wirecut2um_wireradiusscan}c.

\add{ Note: The reflection amplitude easily reaches 0.75 for the first resonance in a 40 um sphere in 70x70 um cell. This is obviously in contrast to the fact that its cross-section is only 1250 um2, whereas the cross-section of the cell is 4900 um2. How is it possible? The explanation lies in that it is the sphere's near field that covers most of the cell's cross-section. This also means that in the aforementioned geometry the resonant fields have to couple to fields in neighbouring spheres in the virtual periodic array. In the detailed view in Mayavi one can easily see that this indeed happens, but fortunately not too much to distort the spectra. (However, for a periodic array the mode splitting cannot be observed because also the fields are periodic in the cells.)

\add{
Dielectric spheres are delimited in all three dimensions, but they have much in common with the dielectric rods. Their behaviour is closer to that of the rods with orientation parallel to the \textit{magnetic field}. The reason is that the lowest-frequency resonance of both structures is generally the magnetic one, whose circulating electric field is localised in the high-permittivity volume of the particle. Higher resonances require a significant part of the electric field to pass through surrounding air.

In contrast with the previous treatment, we used a realistic model \cite{baumard1977_epsilon_TiO2} of rutile (TiO$_{2}$) for the FDTD simulations presented here to illustrate the effect of losses. The permittivity of the spheres was $\varepsilon^{\text{(1 THz)}} = 94.2+2.43\text{i}$, their diameter was set to $r=30\;\upmu$m  and their spacing along each axis was $a =100$ $\upmu$m. The resulting spectra of reflection, transmission and effective parameters are in Fig. %\ref{fg_spheres_fdtd}a.  XXX
A strong magnetic resonance is apparent at 330 GHz, followed by a weaker electric one at 480 GHz and another magnetic one at 670 GHz. Further resonances are gradually less visible due to lower dipole moment and also due to dielectric losses that increase with frequency. 
For completeness, we extend the frequency axis near $a/(2c) \approx 1.5$ THz, where the first Brillouin zone is reached and a classical Bragg band gap is formed.
The main difference compared to the lossless resonances discussed above (cf. Fig.~\ref{fg_rodh_fdtd}) is the continuous index of refraction, that prevents the index of refraction $N'$ near individual resonances to reach the Brillouin zone boundaries and to form clear edges of the bands. As a result, all effective parameters are continuous even near resonances and do not form separate branches.

An important property of the periodic sphere array is its \textit{isotropic} electromagnetic behaviour. It trivially follows from symmetry under any orthogonal rotation, and it also holds almost exactly under any other orientation (unless the spheres are not touching or too high frequencies are studied).

The right plot in Fig. % \ref{fg_spheres_fdtd}b XXX
shows simulation results for the sphere array interlaced with a wire mesh. The wires are directed along the $x$-axis and $y$-axis, the latter orientation being included only to maintain isotropy of the structure. The wires along the $x$-axis, i.e. parallel to the electric field, have a great impact on the spectra. Most importantly, the structure is now highly reflective at low frequencies, and the resonances introduce transmission windows. (Note the previously discussed sphere array acted in opposite way!) The explanation is contained in the effective permittivity plot, where the wires introduce a region of $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} < 0$  ranging from 0 to ca 900 GHz. 

The magnetic resonance introduces narrow regions where $\mu_{\text{eff}} < 0$, thus leading to $N'_{\text{eff}} < 0$ and a propagation mode would occur \cite{dominec2013resonant}. The electric resonance can, on the other hand, overpower the effect of wires so that $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}} > 0$, forming a narrow band with $N'_{\text{eff}} > 0$.
%In practice the resonances are highly lossy, so only the first magnetic resonance introduces a band where the wave can propagate through several cells without being too damped. 

We performed series of experiments to measure the effective permeability  $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ spectrum in a real sample with mean sphere radius of ca. $42\;\upmu$m. The statistical deviation of the resonators size $\sigma \approx 5\;\upmu$m in the sample was unfortunately relatively broad, as was determined by means of microscopy and digital image processing. In contrast to simulations, we were able to constraint the spheres' positions to a plane only, while arranging them in a square array appeared unrealistic. We could anyway compute the single-cell permeability spectra (i. e. the yellow curve in Fig. \ref{fg_experimentalConv}) for many different resonator sizes and add them up. The resulting weighted average (blue curve) then matches the experimental data (red dots) nearly exactly. It shall be however noted that the averaged real part of $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ remained positive even with the best sieving results obtained so far.

Probably the simplest example of such structures is a periodic array of high-permittivity dielectric rods, aligned parallel to the $y$-axis. (We use the convention that the structure is excited by a plane wave source with $\mathbf E || \mathbf x$, $\mathbf H || \mathbf y$ and the wave propagates along the $z$-axis). % dubious - the E, H have many directions in the unit cell; better  to write "TM"/"TE"? But this would confuse with nonperp incidence!
The inhomogeneity of the structure along the $x$-axis allows the electric field to circulate along the rod -- or, more precisely, the $\mathbf E$ field can now be decomposed into purely \textit{planar} part and a purely \textit{circulating} part, that induces a magnetic flux near the rod axis. The circulating electric field is clearly visible on both plots in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}, where all nonzero components of the fields ($H_y$, $E_x$ and $E_z$) are depicted. 

% discuss why this is not true: each lorentzian introduces delta mu -> so the low-frequency permeability of rod array should be > 1? Attracted to a magnet?
This new type of resonance is known as a \textit{magnetic Mie resonance}, \cite{obrien2002photonic, nemec2009tunable, yahiaoui2009broadband, yahiaoui2011tunable}. Unlike the Bragg gaps, it can be observed also in a single rod in free space. Being a function of the frequency of the incident wave, the magnetic dipole moment of the free-standing dielectric rod follows the characteristic Lorentzian shape of its \textit{resonance curve}. Below the resonance the magnetic dipole moment of the resonator goes to strongly positive values, while in a narrow region above the resonance it is strongly negative. How does this behaviour change if we arrange the rods in an infinite periodic array? 


The results from a PWEM computation are plot in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}. To obtain comparable dispersion curves in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh_fdtd}, we employed the FDTD simulation and the effective parameter retrieval described above. The main differences are that in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh_fdtd} we plot the frequency $f$ on the horizontal axis and we also use the effective index of refraction $N_{\text{eff}} := K\cdot \frac{c}{2\pi\,f}$ instead of the wavenumber $K$. One advantage of this representation is that $N_{\text{eff}}$ should be compliant with the Kramers-Kronig relations. This criterion always gives \textit{only one} correct solution on how to unfold $K$ to obtain realistic $N_{\text{eff}}$. 
In the simulation, the rod spacing (or, lattice constant) $a$ was 100 $\upmu$m, so the normalised frequency unit is $c/a = 3$ THz. The frequency range from 0 to 1.8 THz was therefore chosen the same as in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}b. 
Note the first resonance shows pronounced resonant shape in the plot of permeability, which is typical of magnetic Mie resonances. In a very narrow region 960-970 GHz, the permeability $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ is real and negative. 
Apart from $N_{\text{eff}}$, the FDTD computation gives also the effective wave impedance $Z_{\text{eff}}$, which is a complementary information we need to compute the effective permittivity $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ and the effective permeability $\mu_{\text{eff}}$:

\begin{equation} \varepsilon_{\text{eff}} = N_{\text{eff}}/Z_{\text{eff}}, \quad\quad\quad\quad \mu_{\text{eff}} = N_{\text{eff}}\cdot Z_{\text{eff}}.
\label{eq_epsmu}\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]  \caption{Effective parameters of an array of dielectric rods $||\mathbf H$ with same parameters as in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}b (i.e. radius of  12 \% of the period and permittivity $\varepsilon = 100$).

\end{figure}

Other Mie resonances are located at higher frequencies. As a general rule for similar structures, the odd-numbered resonances have magnetic dipole moment (along the rod axis), whereas the even-numbered resonances have electric dipole moment (perpendicular to the rod axis). The reason is that electric dipole moments in odd resonances are suppressed due to antisymmetric shape of the mode; naturally the same holds for the magnetic moments in the even resonances.

The frequency of the Mie resonances is not significantly influenced by the photonic bands. Therefore, in order to understand the resulting band structure and its dependence on parameters, one has to disentangle which band gaps are due to Bragg reflection and which correspond to magnetic or electric Mie resonances. This is much easier knowing the spectra of $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ and $\mu_{\text{eff}}$, as provided by FDTD in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh_fdtd}.

The photonic crystals composed of square lattice of dielectric rods have been examined thoroughly since early 90s \cite{plihal1991two, pendry1992_transfer_matrix}. The permittivity of the constituent materials was rather low, corresponding to the optical or near-infrared frequencies, where the suitable materials usually have permittivity $\varepsilon < 12$. By parametric scans we could prove that for rod permittivity below 60 or even 80, the individual resonance is always located at higher frequency than the Bragg gap. Little, if any, attention was therefore paid to different nature of the higher resonances and most publications focused on properties and applications of the Bragg band gap.

The situation is different in the terahertz range, as the lattice of the crystalline solids often exhibits optical phonons at frequencies between 5 and 20 THz. The permittivity of many materials turns out to be much higher for frequencies below these resonances. This enables to conceive structures composed e.g. of titanium dioxide \cite{baumard1977_epsilon_TiO2} with $\varepsilon^{\text{THz}} \approx 92$ or of ferroelectrics with $\varepsilon^{\text{THz}}$ even orders of magnitude higher \cite{skoromets2011tuning}. The price to be paid for this advantage in the THz range are the relatively high losses caused by the lattice vibrations.

The dielectric bars parallel to the electric field represent the same structure as previously discussed, except that it is orthogonally rotated. There is however a qualitative difference in that the high-permittivity dielectric is continuous along the direction of the electric field, so the effect of the dielectric is expected to be much stronger. This results in that the first Mie resonance is the \textit{electric} one. Its overlap with the next magnetic resonance can eventually lead to negative index of refraction in such a structure \cite{peng2007, vynck2009all}. If the permittivity of the rods is chosen to be $\varepsilon = 100$ and the periodicity of the lattice $a = 100\;\upmu$m, the negative index of refraction occurs in a narrow range of radii from 9 to 12 $\upmu$m. The behaviour of this structure with the desired radius is depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_erod_radius11}a,b.

In order to form a photonic band with a negative index of refraction, both the permittivity and permeability need to be negative. In the structure discussed, this is made possible by the frequencies of the electric and magnetic Mie resonances being close enough to overlap.
The electric resonance would be surrounded by its broad band gap between the frequencies spanning from $0.13 \cdot\frac{c}{100\;\upmu\text{m}} \approx 400$ GHz to  $0.38 \cdot\frac{c}{100\;\upmu\text{m}} \approx 1140$ GHz. This is also confirmed by Fig. \ref{fg_erod_radius11}a where the mode shapes X1 and $\Gamma$4 perfectly correspond to the electric Mie resonance. 

For the interesting range of radii around 11 $\upmu$m, the magnetic resonance introduces a new, narrow photonic band starting from X2. Now, moving on to the right plot of Fig. \ref{fg_erod_radius11}b, we can clearly identify the resonant frequencies of 815 and 900 GHz. They cause abrupt skips of the refractive index which always shift the index of refraction by one Brillouin zone down.\footnote{The individual resonance appears to be the only mechanism that causes $N'_{\text{eff}}$ to \textit{decrease} in the spectrum. In photonic bands, no matter if $N_{\text{eff}} > 0$  or $N_{\text{eff}} < 0$, the real part of $N_{\text{eff}}$ always grows in accordance with the Foster theorem. This is confirmed by the FDTD results and by their compliance to Kramers-Kronig relations. To illustrate this, the Hilbert transform of the refractive index is plotted as the thin pink line and it nearly perfectly follows the green curve over whole spectrum, except for an additive constant. There is  only one acceptable physical solution that is compatible with the Kramers-Kronig relations.}
The resonance is accompanied by a sharp peak in the imaginary part of refractive index $N''$ and by transmission amplitude touching zero ($|t| = 0$). As both Mie resonances precede the Bragg gap, the index of refraction is pushed into negative values and the following photonic band gap $N' < 0$.

For completeness we add the FDTD results with effective permittivity and permeability, computed for the entire spectrum. These quantities however seem to have a useful physical interpretation only within the photonic bands, or within those parts of the photonic band gaps where $N = 0$. 
\\

The dispersion curves of the rods with radii different than 11 $\upmu$m are compared in Fig. \ref{fg_ebar_radiusscan}b based on multiple FDTD simulations. The individual resonances are again easy to be distinguished by abrupt changes from white to blue or vice versa (i.e. skips between the Brillouin zones). We can see that for radii below 8 $\upmu$m the magnetic resonance is at too high frequencies, forming its separate band gap. For even thinner rods at the very bottom edge of the plot, no individual resonance intersects with the first Bragg  band gap at all. 

An interesting qualitative change of the structure response occurs when the rods get slightly thicker than discussed above, say $r > 12\;\upmu$m. The electric and magnetic resonance frequencies do never cross over, but instead they  and an ordinary Bragg band gap remains. The transmission curve of single cell (Fig. \ref{fg_erod_radius11}) continuously shifts up and does not touch zero anymore. We may conclude that for rod radius being too high, the structure no more exhibits the negative index of refraction and starts to behave similar to the 1-D photonic crystal discussed above.
% TODO explanation by nodal planes

%The dependence of the folded wavenumber $\text{Re}(K)$ for high-permittivity rods $||\mathbf E$ is plotted in Fig. \ref{fg_ebar_radiusscan}b. Starting from very thin rods ($r=2$ \um) at the very bottom of the plot, we can see the first band gap (1.3 to 1.5 THz) denoted by darkest blue is purely of the Bragg type, followed by a 

Comparing the low-permittivity and high-permittivity cases in Fig. \ref{fg_ebar_radiusscan}a,b, one can see there exists some minimum limit for the permittivity contrast that is necessary for both electric and magnetic resonances to be located in the first gap simultaneously. We determined this scale-invariant value to be roughly 80.

The transmission peaks can be clearly identified with resonant modes and it was observed that the frequencies of the modes shift with different slope depending on parameters.

Our structure \add{(see Fig.\ref{fg_sketchfield}a)} is defined by a square unit cell with the linear dimension $a$ periodically distributed in the $yz$ plane; the dielectric rod parallel to $x$-axis with radius $\rho$ and permittivity $\varepsilon_r$ is positioned in its center. We employed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation package MEEP \cite{oskooi2010meep} to obtain the scattering coefficients (complex reflectance $r$ and transmittance $t$) of a structure with variable number of unit cells along the wave vector direction $k\parallel z$. The incident wave is polarized $E\parallel x$, periodic boundary conditions were applied in the $y$-direction. We performed the simulations for a single layer ($y$-periodic boundary conditions only). Its effective properties are almost identical to those of the corresponding multilayer structure. We checked that for this geometry, the retrieved effective parameters depend only negligibly on the number of unit cells in the $z$-direction. The relevance of the calculations with a single layer was further confirmed by current-driven homogenization simulations \cite{markel2013current} in several particular cases (same geometries as in Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}) which yielded a response in a very good agreement with the FDTD results.

The effective parameters were \add{then} retrieved from complex transmittance and reflectance spectra \cite{smith2002determination}.  \add{Alternative means of obtaining the effective parameters are discussed in Ref. \cite{simovski2009material}. When inverting the Fresnel-Airy formulas, the correct solutions have to be chosen in the different parts of the $\Neff(\omega)$, $\Zeff(\omega)$ spectra \cite{simovski2009material}; to this aim, Kramers-Kronig relations as well as the conditions of a passive medium Im$(\Neff)>0$ and Re$(\Zeff)>0$ were used.} 

The retrieved value of the complex effective index of refraction $\Neff(f)$ defines the magnitude of the wave vector
\begin{equation}\label{eq_wave_vector} k(f) = 2\pi f \Neff(f) /c\,.  \end{equation}
Note that the retrieval procedure  implies that the wave vector introduced by Eq. (\ref{eq_wave_vector}) is defined in an unfolded reciprocal space. 

A Bragg resonance occurs when an integer number of half-wavelengths fit into one unit cell, i.e.,  when
\begin{equation}\label{eq_BZ} k(f) = \frac{q \pi}{a}\,, \end{equation}
where $q$ is a non-zero integer. In such a situation, the wave vector is located at a Brillouin zone boundary. The purely real values of $k$ then describe photonic band edges.  In a band edge state, a standing wave appears in the structure and it is characterized by exactly $q$ nodal planes dividing each unit cell in the transverse direction to $q+1$ disconnected parts. The band edges delimit a photonic {\itshape Bragg band gap} where only evanescent waves described by $\Neff''>0$ can exist.  We can write an equation analogous to (\ref{eq_BZ}) for the real part of the refractive index:
\begin{equation}\label{eq_BZN} \Neff'(f) = \frac{q c}{2 a f}\,; \end{equation}
its hyperbolic behavior versus frequency reflects the pinning of the wave vector to the Brillouin zone boundary inside the Bragg band gap.

Another case of interest where evanescent waves are obtained is that of $\Neff' = 0$ (center of the first Brillouin zone, $q=0$) and $\Neff''>0$. Here the waves exponentially decay in the medium without any phase change. However, this behavior has a different origin: it is connected to a plasma-like response of the material ($\varepsilon<0$ or $\mu<0$) and in this paper we use the term \textit{plasma band gap} to refer to it.

The Kramers-Kronig relations require that for any structure studied, $\Neff'(f)$ [or, equivalently, $k(f)$] attains and finally crosses the Brillouin-zone boundaries when the frequency is sufficiently increased. While usually the convention is used that the corresponding curves are folded back into the first Brillouin zone, in this paper we plot $\Neff'(f)$ in the original (unfolded) Brillouin zones resulting from the retrieval algorithm. This can be clearly observed on the dispersion of the refractive index in Fig.\ \ref{fg_spec}. In this way we retain the information about the number of the nodal planes intersecting the unit cell, which is important for our discussion.

\todo{FIGURE: Results of the FDTD simulations for a single layer of dielectric rods with $\varepsilon_{\rm r}= 100$, $\rho=10$\,$\upmu$m. The spectra of reflection $|r|$ and transmission $|t|$ amplitudes share their frequency axes with the retrieved complex effective index of refraction $\Neff$, permittivity $\eeff$ and permeability $\meff$, whose imaginary parts are denoted by dashed lines. The frequency ranges where $\eeff$ and $\meff$ have no physical interpretation (Bragg band gaps or higher order photonic bands) are gray shaded.  } 

In the following, we first describe in detail three characteristic cases: we compare the effective parameters computed for three slightly different unit-cell sizes while the rod radius and the dielectric permittivity are fixed. The comparison of these cases reveals quite remarkable changes in the optical behavior of the structure. We then complement this comparison by a continuous scan of the unit-cell sizes in order to obtain an overview of all possible types of the response for the rod-based geometry.  

In Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}, we show the calculated reflectance and transmittance amplitude spectra, as well as the effective parameters of three representative structures which have the same rod radii $\rho = 10$~$\upmu$m, but they differ by the unit-cell size $a =$ 120, 100 and 80 $\upmu$m. These values of $a$ were selected to illustrate three qualitatively different regimes of behavior.  The dielectric was defined by a simple lossy model with one high-frequency oscillator, its  permittivity was $\varepsilon_r = 100.1 + 0.5\mathrm{i}$ at 500 GHz.

\paragraph{Sparse array}
In Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(a), where the unit-cell size $a=120$~$\upmu$m, we can see two well separated Mie resonances: the electric one at 680 GHz and the magnetic one at 1030 GHz.  The field distribution of the corresponding modes is sketched in Fig.~\ref{fg_sketchfield}. The resonance frequencies can be easily identified by an abrupt drop in the real part of the effective index of refraction $\Neff'$, accompanied by a sharp peak in its imaginary part $\Neff''$. The Mie resonances in periodic media without losses must always be adjacent to a Bragg band gap. For instance, in Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(a) at frequencies below the first Bragg gap, the electric dipoles within each rod are directed along the electric field in the rest of the unit cell. The rods thus positively contribute to the refractive index $\Neff'$ which progressively grows until it reaches the first Brillouin zone boundary. At this point, the Bragg condition for a photonic band-gap is fulfilled and each unit cell is intersected by one nodal plane. This is reflected by the dispersion of $\Neff'(f)$ which follows the first Brillouin-zone boundary in the first Bragg band gap between 400 and 680\,GHz [equivalent to $q=1$ in Eq. (\ref{eq_BZN})]: $$	\Neff'(f) = \frac{c}{2af}\,. $$ At 680\,GHz, the electric Mie resonance occurs which dramatically changes the near-field photonic properties of the structure. The observed drop in $\Neff'(f)$ and the slope change in $\Neff''(f)$ mark the plasma-like character of the adjacent part of the band gap which extends up to the plasma frequency of the Mie resonance (940\,GHz). In this frequency range the electric dipoles in the rods change their direction and induce an electric field opposite to the incident one.

For this sparse array of dielectric rods, the first magnetic Mie resonance lies at 1030\,GHz, above the plasma frequency of the electric mode.  The second Bragg band-gap opens at 1010 GHz and, due to the Mie resonance, it is transformed to a plasma band gap at 1030 GHz. The next allowed photonic band starts above magnetic plasma frequencies at 1070 GHz. Therefore we observe a very analogous behavior near the magnetic resonance. 

For completeness we note that at 1350 GHz, a third Bragg band gap starts which, unlike the lower-frequency ones, does not contain any Mie resonances [see Fig.\ \ref{fg_spec}(a)].

The resonances in the effective permittivity $\eeff=\Neff/\Zeff$ and permeability $\meff = \Neff\cdot \Zeff$ of a periodic array obviously exhibit shapes very different from the well-known resonance curves of a damped oscillator\cite{koschny2003resonant}. In the two separate plasma band gaps we obtain either $\eeff < 0$ or $\meff<0$, i.e. the usual behavior observed in the reststrahlen bands of resonances. However, in the Bragg band gaps occurring just below these spectral ranges the behavior of $\eeff$ and $\meff$ does not have any useful physical interpretation and it can be understood as a purely formal frequency dependence: we shaded these ranges with light gray in Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}.
%}}}
\paragraph{Medium array}%{{{
When the unit cell size is reduced to $a=100$~$\upmu$m, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(b), the Mie resonances shift slightly. Interestingly, in comparison with the sparse array, the electric resonance frequency increases from 680 to 780 GHz, and that of the magnetic resonance decreases from 1030 to 980 GHz. This can be explained by the inter-cell coupling: the circulating magnetic field of the first resonance is compressed when the rods get closer, whereas the magnetic dipoles of the second resonance can couple more easily to each other in the same situation (see Fig.~\ref{fg_sketchfield}).

The converging of the resonance frequencies is linked to the most important qualitative change in the spectra: the fact that the magnetic resonance occurs at a frequency where $\eeff'<0$. The first band gap (the lowest continuous frequency region where $\Neff''>0$) is thus composed of three adjacent regimes: the first Bragg band gap (425--780 GHz), a plasma band gap (780--980 GHz) and the second Bragg band gap (980--1020 GHz). Every Mie resonance introduces a drop in $\Neff'$, so the following photonic band (1020--1070 GHz) features a negative index of refraction ($\Neff'<0; \Neff''\approx 0$), i.e., the phase and group velocities are opposite to each other. We conjecture that the presence of two Mie resonances in the \textit{first} combined band gap is a necessary and sufficient condition for $\Neff'<0$ to occur.

Note that the transmittance amplitude reaches quite small values between the Mie resonances when they are sufficiently close to each other [Fig. \ref{fg_spec}(b)]. This range forms a well-defined band with a reflectance-to-transmittance contrast much better than that observed in a planar Fabry-Perot resonator. One layer of dielectric rods with proper parameters can therefore be applied as a thin, yet very effective filter.
%}}}
\paragraph{Dense array}%{{{
Perhaps an even more surprising change occurs when the rod spacing is further reduced. The Mie resonances get even closer in the spectrum and eventually they vanish for $a=80$~$\upmu$m [see Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(c)]. The band gap remains at nearly the same spectral position as in panel (b) of this figure, but, unlike for the medium array, the value of $\Neff'$ does not drop within the Bragg band gap. In contrast, it is shifted up to the second Brillouin zone boundary where it meets the second Bragg band gap as clearly seen in panel (c), indicating that each unit cell is intersected by two nodal planes in this state.

The reason of this behavior is related to the change of the nodal plane topology caused by the inter-cell coupling. When the rods are far from each other ($a\gtrsim 100$~$\upmu$m), the individual Mie resonances create closed regions delimited by a nodal surface where the fields are opposite to the rest of the unit cell. Upon reducing the unit-cell size ($a\lesssim 80$~$\upmu$m), the regions of opposite fields start to overlap with those from the neighboring cells and the corresponding nodal surfaces interconnect and open. This pair of open nodal surfaces dividing the unit cell manifests itself by a qualitative change of the $\Neff'$ spectrum towards a shape typical for one-dimensional photonic crystals.

The Mie resonances are caused by the field confinement near the high permittivity elements. They always manifest themselves as sharp peaks in the imaginary part of the index of refraction ($\Neff''$), and in Fig.~\ref{fg_drawn100} they are denoted by thick solid curves. Their electric- or magnetic-dipole character is identified by the letters "E" or "M" above the plot, respectively.

As it can be seen in Figs.~\ref{fg_spacingscan100} and \ref{fg_drawn100}, the pairs of electric and magnetic Mie resonances form U-shaped curves, at the bottom of which the resonances come closer in frequency to each other and eventually they disappear when the unit-cell size $a$ is further reduced. The resonances influence the whole spectra of the refractive index $\Neff'$, so the position of this U-curve delimits the range of $a$ for which a photonic band with $\Neff' < 0$ and $\Neff'' \approx 0$ can be found. This negative-index band is shown in black in Fig.~\ref{fg_drawn100}.

\label{fg_drawn030}
\end{figure}

Note that the frequencies of the Mie resonances deviate from their free-space values when the rod distance is reduced. In fact, these resonances help to form the photonic band gaps (both Bragg and plasma band gaps) due to their dispersion. As a consequence, these resonances must be always located inside a frequency range with $\Neff''>0$.

\paragraph{Discussion}%{{{
Having analyzed the case of high dielectric ($\varepsilon_r=100$) permittivity rods, we will draw below implications for building a negative-index MM from available dielectrics.  Another series of simulations implies that reducing the dielectric permittivity has the main effect to shift all the Mie resonances to higher frequencies (also with respect to the photonic bands). As a result, the band with $\Neff'<0$ gets gradually narrower and, for the rod permittivity below about 50, we do not find any cell size $a$ that would imply the first and second Mie resonances in the first photonic band as illustrated for $\varepsilon_r = 30$ in Fig. \ref{fg_drawn030}. This means that the value of $\varepsilon_{r} \approx 50$ is the minimum for obtaining a negative index of refraction in any square array of cylindrical rods. Note that one would come to a very similar value of minimum permittivity for the case of a square array of bars with a slightly different shape, e.g. a square cross-section. 

A sufficiently high permittivity can be found in the microwave and terahertz ranges, in a variety of materials, for example in titanium dioxide with $\varepsilon_r \approx 92$ \cite{nemec2009tunable} or in various ferroelectrics like strontium titanate \cite{skoromets2011tuning}. However, practical applications of the high-permittivity dielectrics in the THz range can be restricted by high dielectric losses due to low-frequency phonon absorption tails. To our knowledge, there is no material providing such a high permittivity in the near-infrared or optical ranges. This eliminates the possibility to build a MM at these frequencies with $\Neff'<0$ based on dielectric rods.

Finding a valid negative index of refraction $\Neff'$ for a photonic structure implies that the Snell law can be used to predict the negative refraction at an interface, provided the iso-frequency contours can be well approximated by a circle. This condition is fulfilled when the resulting wave vector is oriented close to a symmetry axis of the structure, or when the wave vector is negligible compared to the reciprocal lattice vector (i.e. $k\ll \frac{\pi}{a}$ and thus $|\Neff'| \ll \frac{c}{2af}$).  In the latter case the iso-frequency contours of the isotropic structure approach a circular shape near the $\Gamma$-point in the Brillouin zone center.  By contrast, the opposite implication is not necessarily applicable---a structure with a high enough spatial dispersion can still refract under negative angles, yet its refractive index computed along a symmetry axis never reaches negative values and the phase difference across each its unit cell is positive and can be comparable to $\pi$.  For example, it was suggested earlier  \cite{vynck2009all} that an array of silicon rods ($\varepsilon_r \approx 12$) can constitute a true left-handed metamaterial ($\Neff'<0$).  In agreement with the results presented above, we believe that the negative refraction is not a sufficient proof of $\Neff'<0$, which would require a much higher permittivity contrast than that of silicon.  We conclude that the electromagnetic behavior observed previously \cite{vynck2009} has to be described by means of the PhC dispersion curves. 

We demonstrated that for $\Neff'<0$, not only the high permittivity contrast, but also a correct geometry is required. A wedge filled with an array of square-shaped high-dielectric bars was previously reported refracting under negative angles \cite{peng2007}. The high filling fraction ($0.44^{2}$) simultaneously with a permittivity of $\varepsilon_r \approx 600$ clearly qualified this structure as \textit{dense}. Using the above described approach, we computed its spectra qualitatively similar to Fig.~\ref{fg_spec}(c) and no band with $\Neff' < 0$ was resulting from our effective index retrieval. However, when we reproduced the wedge experiment numerically, our simulations confirmed that it does refract the light under negative angles.

This structure lies at the boundary between the criteria for MMs and PhCs described in the Introduction.  To determine its refraction angle, in general, it is not possible to use the concept of the effective refractive index and its iso-frequency contours have to be used instead (like in PhCs). At the same time, this structure was proved to partially retain negative refraction even under randomization of the positions of the dielectric bars \cite{peng2007}, implying that most of the resonant energy is concentrated inside the dielectric (which is characteristic of MMs).

Let us note that our group received another fishnet sample made by automated mechanical drilling (Fig. \ref{fg_fishnet_mechanical}) into a double-sided circuit board blank, consisting of two 30 $\upmu$m copper foils glued to a plastic. The sample was measured by the terahertz spectroscopy yielding relatively complicated spectra, which could not be reasonably matched by any of the simulations. We assume that the clash between the measured and simulated values comes from the imprecision in the sample itself, namely from the burrs from drilling.

Part of the fishnets were made of two foils as a metal-insulator-metal structure, but their spectra were also hard to interpret.
