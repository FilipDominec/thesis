The structure composed of alternating dielectric layers, effectively a one-dimensional photonic crystal, has been investigated thoroughly in the previous decades. We review it mostly for comparison with the structures presented in the following. 

\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{Dispersion curves for an one-dimensional photonic crystal, computed using PWEM.

% TODO draw and append axes+colorbar to the field distribution plots
% TODO visualise the permittivity, but how?

In Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}a, we can see the folded dispersion curves for a plane wave propagating in vacuum, as already discussed above. 
%As predicted by the Bloch-Floquet theorem (\ref{eq_bloch}), the fields are periodic over each cell whenever the wavenumber $k$ touches the Brillouin zone boundary. 
To save space, we plot the  dispersion curves as \textit{folded}, but one can easily imagine how the curve unfolds into a straight light line. For any frequency $f$, there is a wavenumber $k$ corresponding to a propagating wave. 


The situation is different when we introduce periodic dielectric layers as in Fig. \ref{fg_1dbd}b. In the band structure, we observe allowed bands with \textit{band gaps} between them. At the frequencies in a bandgap, the wave can not propagate through the structure. The first photonic band ends when half the wavelength matches the cell spacing, i.e. when $2\pi / K= a/2$. The next band starts at the same wavenumber $K$, but the wave now has higher frequency because it is shifted by half its period so that it maximizes electric energy in air. For a 1-D photonic crystal, we can generally conclude that in order to move up on the frequency axis,
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{within each photonic band, one nodal plane per unit cell is added\footnote{In this paper, the mode plots show $2\times 2$ unit cells for clarity.},} 
 \item{within each photonic band gap, the wave shifts the most of electric field energy into lower-permittivity medium\footnote{Note that the band gaps do not have the same width on the frequency scale. For a certain thickness of the high-dielectric layer that corresponds to the Fabry-Pérot resonance, no frequency difference at all results from shifting the wave. In this case the band gap attains zero thickness, as is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fg_ebar_radiusscan}a for $r\approx20\,\upmu$m and $f\approx1.6$ THz. In other words, there may be a \textit{gap-less} transition between photonic bands.}, while the number of nodal planes remains constant. }
 \end{enumerate}

Such a shifting between waves at the lower and upper boundaries of the band gap is typical of classical \textit{Bragg} gaps that are responsible for the dispersion of the 1-D photonic crystal.

% todo? analytic Mie resonance frequency? -> OBrien&Pendry2002, szabos etc
\add{
Are there also different, non-Bragg, mechanisms that can create band gaps?


We would not indeed pose this question if its answer were negative. It is closely related to the \textit{internal resonances} based on non-propagating evanescent fields in the structure. The operation of all sorts of left-handed metamaterials  relies on these resonances. We conjecture such resonances may never occur in 1-D dielectric structures, so their study requires a simulation of a 2-D or 3-D structure.
% Todo elaborate the idea of nonBragg gap <-> nonradiative fields in structure <-> permittivity/permeability resonance

Probably the simplest example of such structures is a periodic array of high-permittivity dielectric rods, aligned parallel to the $y$-axis. (We use the convention that the structure is excited by a plane wave source with $\mathbf E || \mathbf x$, $\mathbf H || \mathbf y$ and the wave propagates along the $z$-axis). % dubious - the E, H have many directions in the unit cell; better  to write "TM"/"TE"? But this would confuse with nonperp incidence!
The inhomogeneity of the structure along the $x$-axis allows the electric field to circulate along the rod -- or, more precisely, the $\mathbf E$ field can now be decomposed into purely \textit{planar} part known from the previous section, and a purely \textit{circulating} part, that induces a magnetic flux near the rod axis. The circulating electric field is clearly visible on both plots in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}, where all nonzero components of the fields ($H_y$, $E_x$ and $E_z$) are depicted. 

% discuss why this is not true: each lorentzian introduces delta mu -> so the low-frequency permeability of rod array should be > 1? Attracted to a magnet?
This new type of resonance is known as a \textit{magnetic Mie resonance}, \cite{obrien2002photonic, nemec2009tunable, yahiaoui2009broadband, yahiaoui2011tunable}. Unlike the Bragg gaps, it can be observed also in a single rod in free space. Being a function of the frequency of the incident wave, the magnetic dipole moment of the free-standing dielectric rod follows the characteristic Lorentzian shape of its \textit{resonance curve}. Below the resonance the magnetic dipole moment of the resonator goes to strongly positive values, while in a narrow region above the resonance it is strongly negative. How does this behaviour change if we arrange the rods in an infinite periodic array?

The results from a PWEM computation are plot in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}. To obtain comparable dispersion curves in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh_fdtd}, we employed the FDTD simulation and the effective parameter retrieval described above. The main differences are that in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh_fdtd} we plot the frequency $f$ on the horizontal axis and we also use the effective index of refraction $N_{\text{eff}} := K\cdot \frac{c}{2\pi\,f}$ instead of the wavenumber $K$. One advantage of this representation is that $N_{\text{eff}}$ should be compliant with the Kramers-Kronig relations. This criterion always gives \textit{only one} correct solution on how to unfold $K$ to obtain realistic $N_{\text{eff}}$. 
In the simulation, the rod spacing (or, lattice constant) $a$ was 100 $\upmu$m, so the normalised frequency unit is $c/a = 3$ THz. The frequency range from 0 to 1.8 THz was therefore chosen the same as in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}b. 
Note the first resonance shows pronounced resonant shape in the plot of permeability, which is typical of magnetic Mie resonances. In a very narrow region 960-970 GHz, the permeability $\mu_{\text{eff}}$ is real and negative. 
Apart from $N_{\text{eff}}$, the FDTD computation gives also the effective wave impedance $Z_{\text{eff}}$, which is a complementary information we need to compute the effective permittivity $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ and the effective permeability $\mu_{\text{eff}}$:

\begin{equation} \varepsilon_{\text{eff}} = N_{\text{eff}}/Z_{\text{eff}}, \quad\quad\quad\quad \mu_{\text{eff}} = N_{\text{eff}}\cdot Z_{\text{eff}}.
\label{eq_epsmu}\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]  \caption{Effective parameters of an array of dielectric rods $||\mathbf H$ with same parameters as in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh}b (i.e. radius of  12 \% of the period and permittivity $\varepsilon = 100$).

Thin grey lines indicate the Brillouin zone boundaries.}

\end{figure}

Other Mie resonances are located at higher frequencies. As a general rule for similar structures, the odd-numbered resonances have magnetic dipole moment (along the rod axis), whereas the even-numbered resonances have electric dipole moment (perpendicular to the rod axis). The reason is that electric dipole moments in odd resonances are suppressed due to antisymmetric shape of the mode; naturally the same holds for the magnetic moments in the even resonances.

The frequency of the Mie resonances is not significantly influenced by the photonic bands. Therefore, in order to understand the resulting band structure and its dependence on parameters, one has to disentangle which band gaps are due to Bragg reflection and which correspond to magnetic or electric Mie resonances. This is much easier knowing the spectra of $\varepsilon_{\text{eff}}$ and $\mu_{\text{eff}}$, as provided by FDTD in Fig. \ref{fg_rodh_fdtd}.
\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{The spectra of the wavenumber $K$ for different rod radii and two different rod permittivities.

The photonic crystals composed of square lattice of dielectric rods have been examinated thoroughly since early 90s \cite{plihal1991two, pendry1992_transfer_matrix}. The permittivity of the constituent materials was rather low, corresponding to the optical or near-infrared frequencies, where the suitable materials usually have permittivity $\varepsilon < 12$. By parametric scans we could prove that for rod permittivity below 60 or even 80, the individual resonance is always located at higher frequency than the Bragg gap. Little, if any, attention was therefore paid to different nature of the higher resonances and most publications focused on properties and applications of the Bragg band gap.

The situation is different in the terahertz range, as the lattice of the crystalline solids often exhibits optical phonons at frequencies between 5 and 20 THz. The permittivity of many materials turns out to be much higher for frequencies below these resonances. This enables to conceive structures composed e.g. of titanium dioxide \cite{baumard1977_epsilon_TiO2} with $\varepsilon^{\text{THz}} \approx 92$ or of ferroelectrics with $\varepsilon^{\text{THz}}$ even orders of magnitude higher \cite{skoromets2011tuning}. The price to be paid for this advantage in the THz range are the relatively high losses caused by the lattice vibrations.
