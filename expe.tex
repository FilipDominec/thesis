\paragraph{Algorithm desciption} %{{{
Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) is one of the simplest methods for solving partial differential equations (PDE). The simulation volume is initialized as an array in the computer memory, each element of which corresponds to a \textit{voxel} in the orthogonal grid. When FDTD is applied to solve the Maxwell equations in three dimensions, six real numbers per voxel describe the electric and magnetic vector fields, another static scalar array describes the permittivity of the structure and additional arrays may correspond other physical quantities, such as material conductivity, material polarizabilities and polarizations etc. Two-dimensional computations can reduce the number of arrays thanks to symmetry.

The actual computation is realized in consecutive time steps as an explicit arithmetic operation on each voxel, taking into account only the field values in the neighboring voxels and in the previous time step. This corresponds to iterating equations (\ref{eq_me3}), (\ref{eq_me4}) and (\ref{eq_ce}). % unclear - specify the field update routine exactly
Most of the computation time is thus occupied by a simple and unconditional loop repeatedly updating all voxels, which allows to fully employ the processor cache and facilitates multi-processor parallelisation. FDTD is applicable to (possibly non-linear) problems where either the temporal evolution of the fields is searched for, or for linear systems where a frequency-domain response function can be found by Fourier-transforming the time-domain response.

The time-stepping routine has the same computing cost in empty vacuum as inside a complex structure. Grid-based methods such as FDTD are therefore most efficient to problems where a structure has relatively complex shape, but its smallest features are no more than two or three orders of magnitude smaller than the simulation size. In contrast, an accurate-enough simulation of a structure that has some few very fine features surrounded by big empty space would require excessively high resolution, often resulting in the great majority of the voxels being inefficiently used in space where the high resolution is not needed. Other methods, % TODO discussed below
such as Finite-element method or Boundary-element method, would be preferable for such cases.

As is widely used in the later chapters,  %% TODO illustrate it below!
simulations of a wave propagating in any periodic structure can make use of the periodic boundaries of the simulated volume, so that only one unit cell has to be computed to get result of an infinite structure. The unit cells of periodic structures discussed in this thesis have smallest features not less than two orders of magnitude smaller than the unit cell size, and besides one is often interested in obtaining the whole spectrum information, so FDTD was an optimal tool for this task.
%}}}
\paragraph{Spatial discretisation} %{{{
The discretisation of the grid and of the time stepping introduces an error that obviously manifests in imprecise description of the structure being simulated (\textit{staircasing}) and also in the \textit{numerical dispersion} \cite{taflove2005book}, that is, in deviation of the light speed from the correct one at higher frequencies.  % todo is something missing?
\begin{figure}[h] \caption{\textbf{a)}, \textbf{b)} Different two-dimensional grids are used for different polarizations of the fields. \textbf{c)} The three-dimensional Yee grid. The electric field components are expressed in the centers of the cube edges which they are parallel to, whereas the magnetic components are expressed in the centers of the cube which they are perpendicular to. Note the electric and magnetic fields are completely equal in this scheme; the description in terms of edges and faces could be interchanged if the brown cube was taken as the elementary one.} \label{fg_fdtd_yee} \centering 
	\includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/FDTD_Yee_grid_2d-3d.pdf}
\end{figure}

The error due to the numerical dispersion is in most FDTD implementations reduced from first to second order ($\propto \Delta x^{-2}$ with regards to the voxel size $\Delta x$) by using a \textit{staggered grid}, which in three dimensions is also known as Yee grid \cite{yee1966numerical}. All six field components are expressed in different points within the voxel, as is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fg_fdtd_yee}c with the upper left (green) cube denoting the elementary one. 
%This is similar to the advantage of trapezoid integration instead of direct summation. % TODO figure
Likewise, the update of electric and magnetic fields have to be interlaced also in time (as a so-called \textit{leapfrog} process). When accessing the field values at a given position and time, each field component has to be properly averaged between nearest points in the grid, and between nearest update times.


By adequate averaging of permittivity on the boundaries of materials, this error can likewise be reduced to the quadratic order with regards to $\Delta x$. Various averaging approaches have been studied in the literature \cite{oskooi2010meep}. Arithmetic averaging of permittivity with weight proportional to the voxel volume occupied by the material is perhaps the most intuitive one, but it often gives wrong results, and  sometimes it is even worse than no averaging at all \cite{farjadpour2006improving,deinega2007subpixel}. In case of a single planar interface of two different materials under general orientation, the arithmetic average of the permittivities $\varepsilon_r$ is correct only for electric field component \textit{parallel} with the interface, whereas the component \textit{perpendicular} to the interface requires instead to apply this weighted averaging to the reciprocal value of permittivity, $\varepsilon_r^{-1}$. Such an approach is extremely accurate for all interfaces with low curvature, but requires the FDTD simulation to define the permittivity as a $3\times 3$ tensor array (even in the simple case of isotropic materials being used). The situation gets even more  complicated if the materials have dispersive permittivity, where also the weighting coefficients of both media need to be frequency-dependent, and another sophisticated approach has to be employed \cite{deinega2007subpixel,hamm2013dispersive}. Such a level of elaboration easily leads to computation costs that may outweight the benefit of averaging, and accordingly no averaging was used for the simulations presented in this thesis. 

Generally, the effect of discretization in FDTD can be easily identified by comparing results from two simulations that only differ by the grid resolution. It is a good practice to verify that such an error is negligible whenever a new simulation is tested.
%}}}

\paragraph{Temporal discretisation} %{{{
While the spatial resolution $\Delta x$ can be relatively freely set depending on the accuracy expected by the user, the \textit{temporal resolution} $\Delta t$ is related to $\Delta x$ by rules that will be discussed below. Generally, if $\Delta t$ is set too high, the simulation will get numerically unstable, yielding unrealistic or even infinite values.  %  slowing down the computation and

In the literature, one often encounters that instead of description in terms of $\Delta t$, the \textit{Courant factor} $S$ is used:
\begin{equation} S~= \frac{c \Delta t}{\Delta x}, \label{eq_courant}\end{equation}
In words, the Courant factor $S$ denotes what part of a FDTD cell the light can travel within one time step. 
The reason for introducing this quantity is in that the Maxwell equations [Eq. (\ref{eq_me1}-\ref{eq_me4})] are scale invariant, and so is the field update routine in FDTD when materials with frequency-independent permittivity are used. Therefore, when resolution $\Delta x$ is changed, $S$ can be a well-chosen built-in constant and the time resolution given by Eq. (\ref{eq_courant}) ensures that the simulation does not go unstable.

FDTD obviously ceases to be scale-invariant whenever the properties of the materials depend on the frequency, which is needed for most realistic simulations. Then it appears more convenient to the autor to formally introduce yet another quantity, a \textit{critical frequency} $f_c$:
\begin{equation} f_c := \frac{1}{\pi \, \Delta t} \equiv \frac{c}{\pi\, S\, \Delta x} \label{eq_fc}\end{equation}
Note that this frequency is defined as different (i.e. $\pi$-times lower) than the frequency of time-stepping cycles is. It is however the value of $f_c$, and its relation to the model of materials used, that is of key importance for assessing numerical stability of simulation.

%A fundamental rule is the way how materials are defined in FDTD.

As described in Chapter \ref{chap_lorentzmedia}, the (local) response of usual media to an electromagnetic wave can be well approximated by a set of Lorentz oscillators, each of which is defined by three positive real numbers: its resonance angular frequency $\omega_{0m}$, damping rate $\gamma_m$ and oscillator strength $F_m$: % todo cite 
$$\hspace{3cm} \epsrl(\omega) = 1 + \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{F_m}{\omega_{0m}^2 - \omega^2 + \ii\omega\gamma_m} \hspace{3cm}\text{(\ref{eq_lorentz_eps} again)}$$
FDTD, being a time-domain method, requires the media to be described in a similar way with the difference that the nondispersive part of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{r\infty}$ can be chosen as a real number. 
\begin{equation} \epsrl(\omega) = \varepsilon_{r\infty} + \sum_{m=1}^M \frac{F_m}{\omega_{0m}^2 - \omega^2 + \ii\omega\gamma_m} \label{eq_lorentz_eps_fdtd} \end{equation}
%It is not possible to directly supply the permittivity as an arbitrary function of frequency from fundamental reasons. 
%We thus return to the local Drude-Lorentz theory, with a due emphasis on the definition of materials in FDTD.
% we focus on this topic because in literature, either general theory is discussed, or just single working model  is used. We try to develop reliable rules for employing the FDTD to simulate realistic structures under as general circumstances as possible.

%}}}
\paragraph{Conditions of stability in FDTD}%{{{
%it was noted above that too high frequency of oscillators may introduce instability. 
%An important parameter is the critical frequency of the simulation, $f_c$ defined as 
% \begin{equation} f_c = \frac{c}{\pi \, C \, \Delta x},\label{eq_}\end{equation}
% where the \textit{Courant factor} $C$ is usually set to $C:=0.5$ and $c \approx 2.998 \cdot 10^8$ m/s is the speed of light. The voxel size thus determines the critical frequency; in a simulation typical for this thesis, $\Delta x := 2$ $\upmu$m and the critical frequency $f_c \approx 95$ THz lies in the mid-infrared. For simulations in visible range with $\Delta x := 50$ nm, and $f_c \approx 3800$ THz, that is, in the regime of hard UV radiation.

%The critical frequency may be viewed as the upper limit where an FDTD simulation gives plausible data. 
Author observed that $f_c$ determines the constraints for the simulation stability in two ways simultaneously:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{The resonance frequencies must be below the critical frequency,  %% TODO get a proof, or some citation, or cite MEEP sources where S.G.Johnson wrote a routine about this
\begin{equation} \frac{\omega_{0m}}{2\pi} < f_c, \text{ for all oscillators, } \forall m \in \{1,2 \ldots M\}, \label{eq_fdtd_stability}\end{equation}
independent of what the strength $F_m$ or damping rate $\gamma_m$ of the oscillator is. 
%This relates to the above note about expressing all high-frequency oscillators in the form of the high-frequency (static) permittivity. . 
} 
 \item{The real part of the permittivity, as given in Eq. (\ref{eq_lorentz_eps_fdtd}), must be above a minimum value given by the Courant factor $S$ for all frequencies higher than the critical frequency $f_c$:
\begin{equation} \varepsilon_r'(2\pi\,f) > 3 S^{2} \equiv 3 \left( \frac{c \Delta t}{\Delta x} \right)^{2} \text{ for } \forall f \geq f_c. \label{eq_fdtd_stability_realp}\end{equation}  } % TODO verify whether the limit is eps>0 or e.g. eps>0.5 or whatever 
A geometrical interpretation of this rule is that the instability is introduced when any wave, of frequency above the critical frequency, can travel more than $1/\sqrt{3}$ of one FDTD cell size within one time step. 
Note that in a nonmagnetic medium, the traveled distance is $$\frac{c\Delta t}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r'}}.$$
\end{enumerate}
The FDTD simulation will become unstable if one or both of these rules are broken. The error from the instability initially arises from inevitable numerical noise at the boundary of the problematic material and grows exponentially. It can be identified as a pixel-wise checkerboard pattern on the field snapshot. Later the field visualisation usually returns black images as the numerical infinity is reached within several tens of FDTD steps. 

\paragraph{Choice of the Courant factor}%{{{
Provided that a part of the simulation volume is empty vacuum with $\varepsilon_r'=1$, Eq. (\ref{eq_fdtd_stability_realp}) clearly determines the \textit{maximum value of Courant factor} 
$$S_{max} = 3^{-1/2}\approx0.577.$$
In practice, a slightly more conservative choice is made that provides a safe margin for the numerical imprecision: 
\begin{equation} S:= 0.500 \quad \rightarrow \quad \varepsilon_r'(2\pi\,f)> 0.75, \quad \forall f \geq f_c. \label{eq_courant_choice}\end{equation}
For any material with problematic high-frequency permittivity, $\varepsilon_r'(2\pi\,f_c) \in (0, 1)$, some low value of $S$ can be found that makes the simulation stable against the second rule. Simultaneously, the critical frequency shifts up, so potential problems with the first rule may be alleviated, too. This is however at the price of scaling up the number of required FDTD steps, so usually a reasonable change of the material definition is made instead of reducing $S$.

\add{
This is related to the \textit{Courant criterion} \cite{taflove2005book} that states for a nondispersive medium of permittivity $\varepsilon_r$ that

\paragraph{Practical aspects of material definition} %{{{
In all realistic media, the frequencies of different oscillators span over many orders of magnitude, and an accurate medium model would need to determine tens or hundreds of oscillators. Not all oscillators should be defined for a given FDTD simulation, however.

First of all, high-frequency oscillators would make the simulation unstable.
Aside from this, adding overly many oscillators is also inefficient, because each oscillator defined increases computing difficulty in FDTD. 
It is therefore advisable to weed the oscillators to a minimum acceptable number necessary, and to describe the material within some frequency range of interest (FRoI) % TODO  define range of interest
only:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{
%Often the first step in processing FDTD results lies in converting them to frequency domain via Fourier transform. 
The upper bound for FRoI is limited by numerical stability as stated above. Mostly, a more strict limit is given by the spatial resolution of the simulation: In a high-permittivity material, high frequencies correspond to wavelengths similar to the voxel size (or even smaller than it), leading to significant inaccuracy. 

Each oscillator far above the frequency of interest shall be expressed only as a constant added to the nondispersive part of permittivity $\varepsilon_{r\infty}$. This contribution is given by Eq. (\ref{eq_delta_eps}) as 
$$\Delta \varepsilon_r = \frac{F}{\omega_0^2}.$$ 
If some of the high-frequency oscillators introduces significant dispersion or losses in the FRoI, it it should not be eliminated this way. This usually concerns the oscillator that is the closest above FRoI, and it usually can be maintained without causing instability.
} 
 \item{
Very low frequencies, corresponding to wavelengths much greater than the whole simulation volume, are theoretically accessible with a long-enough FDTD simulation, but the FRoI usually does not reach zero frequency, mostly for practical reasons. If needed, the low-frequency phenomena can often be computed more efficiently in a separate simulation with a lower resolution or even with different numerical methods.

The oscillators at frequencies too low can therefore be omitted without any change to the behaviour within the FRoI. One important exception is the low-frequency oscillator that defines conductive behaviour, as described below.
} 
 \end{enumerate}
%}}}

\paragraph{Drude model for conductive media} %{{{
The Drude model assumes the relative permittivity in the form
\begin{equation} \epsr(\omega) = 1 + \frac{\omega_p^{2}}{0 - \omega^{2} + \ii\gamma\omega} = 1 - \frac{\omega_p^{2}}{\omega^{2} - \ii\gamma\omega}, \label{eq_drude_eps}\end{equation}
where $\omega_p$ and $\gamma$ are two independent parameters that describe the metal: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item{$\omega_p$ is the \textit{plasma frequency}, at which the real part of permittivity crosses zero. The physical consequence is that for $\omega > \omega_p$ the medium allows the transverse electromagnetic wave to propagate through. 
%The angular frequency of $\omega_p$, the longitudinal (electric) waves oscillate. 
%The quasiparticle associated with the oscillation of the charge in bulk conductive medium, a \textit{plasmon}, has given the name to $\omega_p$. % TODO add a relation to the chapter on "dispersion in local media"
 } 
 \item{$\gamma$ maintains its meaning as the \textit{rate of exponential decay} of the medium response to an impulse. The Drude model was conceived in the early 20th century, with the simplified hypothesis that electrons would be freely propagating particles that undergo collisions with the atoms at an average frequency $\gamma$. Upon the colision, their speed would either drop to zero, or (equivalently) would be randomized. Although the mechanism of resistivity is more complicated than this, the parameter $\gamma$ is commonly denoted as the \textit{scattering frequency}.} 
 \end{itemize}
%Both have the dimension of $\mathrm{rad\; s^{-1}}$. 
The Drude model can thus be considered a specific case of a Lorentz oscillator with $\omega_0 = 0$, and oscillator strength given by $F = \omega_p^2$. 
Obviously, using Eq. (\ref{eq_delta_eps}) to compute the contribution of the Drude term to the real part of permittivity would give infinite values, as static electric field can displace unlimited amount of charge in a conductor.

If $\gamma$ is nonzero, the permittivity is a complex function and it can be separated into its real and imaginary part $\varepsilon_r = \varepsilon_r'+\ii\varepsilon_r''$ by expanding the fraction in (\ref{eq_drude_eps}) by complex conjugate of its denominator
\begin{equation} \varepsilon_r = 1 - \omega_p^{2} \cdot \frac{\omega^{2} + \ii \gamma \omega}{\omega^{4} + \gamma^{2} \omega^{2}} = 
		\underbrace{\left(1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2+\gamma^2}\right) }_{\text{real part } \varepsilon_r'}
+ \ii	\underbrace{\left(\frac{-\omega_p^2\gamma}{\omega^3 + \gamma^2\omega}\right) }_{\text{imaginary part } \varepsilon_r''}.
\label{eq_drude_eps_loss}\end{equation}
%The real part $\varepsilon_r'$ indicates capacitive or reactive behaviour of the metal. The imaginary part $\varepsilon_r''$ describes losses which may arise either from 
% \underbrace{ }_{\text{}}
The low- and high-frequency limits of permittivity given by the Drude model are:
\begin{equation} \lim_{\omega \to 0} \varepsilon_r' = 1-\frac{\omega_p^2}{\gamma^2}, \quad \quad  
				 \lim_{\omega \to 0} (\varepsilon_r'' \cdot \omega) = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\gamma},\label{eq_drude_limlow}\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \lim_{\omega \to +\infty} \varepsilon_r' = 1, \quad \quad  
				 \lim_{\omega \to +\infty} (\varepsilon_r'' \cdot \omega^3) = -\omega_p^2 \gamma. \label{eq_drude_limup}\end{equation}
We can see that in the low frequency limit, the imaginary part of permittivity diverges (while its real part has a finite value). In the high frequency limit, the metal permittivity approaches that of vacuum, i.e. $1+0\ii$.
%}}}
\label{chap_fdtd_drude}
\paragraph{Low- and high-frequency limits of conductivity in the Drude model}%{{{
The notion of \textit{conductivity} is widely used to describe metals and doped semiconductors, i.e. media where the response to the electric field is characteristic by the motion of free charge carriers. 
Generally, both permittivity $\varepsilon_r(\omega)$ and conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ are complex functions of the angular frequency $\omega$. As long as the approximation of negligible spatial dispersion is used, each of them is fully determined by the other function. % maybe even if spatial dispersion is nonzero -> check this?
For clarity, we avoid using the conductivity in the rest of the thesis except this chapter.

The relation between $\varepsilon_r(\omega)$ and $\sigma(\omega)$
 can be derived by realizing that the current in a material is always caused by movement of charges with density $\rho$ and average velocity $\mathbf{v}(t)$. The conduction and polarisation currents are not distinguished here, as their density is given as $\rho \mathbf{v}(t)$ in both cases. When current is excited by a harmonic electric field $E(t) = \mathrm{e}^{\ii\omega t}$: %TODO FIXME explain rho.n, use i omega t instead of -i omega t, check again...
\begin{equation} \rho \mathbf{v}(t) = \sigma(\omega) E(t) = \sigma(\omega) \mathrm{e}^{\ii\omega t}, \quad\text{ (conduction approach -- Ohm law)} \label{eq_rho_n1}\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \rho \mathbf{v}(t) = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r(\omega) \frac{\partial E(t)}{\partial t} = \ii \omega \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r(\omega) \mathrm{e}^{\ii\omega t} . \quad\text{ (displacement current approach)} \label{eq_rho_n2}\end{equation}
Both above equations describe the same quantity, so
\begin{equation} \sigma(\omega) = \ii \omega \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r(\omega), \quad  \text{and} \quad  \varepsilon_r(\omega)  = \frac{\sigma(\omega)}{\ii \omega \varepsilon_0}. \label{eq_drude_sigma}\end{equation}
Thus, a dielectric medium with real constant permittivity has \textit{imaginary} conductivity, magnitude of which grows with frequency (cf. the admittance of a capacitor). A conductor with real constant conductivity has complex permittivity, and its imaginary part diverges in the low-frequency limit. 
% NOTE: eps_r = eps_r' + i eps_r'',   
% sigma = sigma' + i sigma'' == i omega eps0 eps_r == i omega eps0 eps_r' - omega eps0 eps_r''
% therefore a material can be described also using real epsilon = eps_r', and real conductivity sigma' = -omega eps0 eps_r''

\begin{figure}[t] \caption{Permittivity and conductivity plot for gold; vertical scale and the yellow region forbidden by the stability rules are the same as in Fig. \ref{fg_tio2eps_stripped}. The exact model of gold % TODO \cite{palik} 
(red) is compared to the lossy Drude model with Lorentz oscillators substituted by $\varepsilon_r$ (blue), and for illustration, also to the lossless Drude model with scattering frequency set to zero (grey). Obviously, none of these models is numerically stable if $f_c = 95$ THz.
\\The bottom plot shows the conductivity of these three models as given by Eq. (\ref{eq_drude_sigma}).}

	\includegraphics[width=14cm]{img/epsilon_Au_models_llgrey.pdf} % Scattering freq of gold = 12.8 THz
\end{figure}


Using the above relation (\ref{eq_drude_sigma}) to convert metal permittivity $\varepsilon_r(\omega)$ into conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$, and substituting the Drude-model permittivity (\ref{eq_drude_eps_loss}), we obtain
\begin{equation} \sigma(\omega) = \ii \omega \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r(\omega)= \ii\omega \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r'(\omega)  -  \omega \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r''(\omega) = 
	\ii \underbrace{\varepsilon_0 \left(\omega - \frac{\omega_p^2\omega}{\omega^2+\gamma^2}\right)}_{\text{imaginary part } \sigma''}  + 
		\underbrace{\varepsilon_0\frac{\omega_p^2\gamma}{\omega^2+\gamma^2}}_{\text{real part } \sigma'}. \label{eq_drude_sigmaeps1}\end{equation}
We may now express the low- and high-frequency limits also for conductivity:
\begin{equation} \sigma_{LF} := \lim_{\omega \to 0} \sigma' = \frac{\omega_p^2\varepsilon_0}{\gamma}, \quad \quad  
				 \lim_{\omega \to 0} (\sigma'' / \omega) = \varepsilon_0 - \frac{\omega_p^2 \varepsilon_0}{\gamma^2} , \label{eq_drude_sigmalimlow}\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \lim_{\omega \to +\infty} (\sigma' \cdot \omega^2) = \varepsilon_0\omega_p^2\gamma, \quad \quad  
				 \lim_{\omega \to +\infty} (\sigma'' / \omega) = \varepsilon_0. \label{eq_drude_sigma_limup}\end{equation}
Let us note again that in the literature that uses the negative phase convention $e^{-\ii \omega t}$, the resulting $\varepsilon_r(\omega)$ and $\sigma(\omega)$ are complex conjugated to the results above.

\paragraph{Defining resistive metals for stable low-resolution simulations} %{{{
Simulations in the optical range are relatively safe in terms of numerical stability. From Eq. (\ref{eq_fc}) it follows that the resolution of $\Delta x = 50$ nm, suitable for NIR/visible spectrum, yields the critical frequency $f_c = 3.82\cdot 10^{15}$ Hz ($\lambda = c/f_c \approx 78$ nm), which is far above the plasma frequency of metals or other conductors. Accordingly, no changes are usually needed to be made in the Drude model, although the simulation may run faster if one or more Lorentz terms outside FRoI can be omitted.
%If high precision of the metal model is needed, one is also free to add one or more Lorentz oscillators in the optical/UV range to refine the shape of permittivity.
 
Realistic simulations of metals at lower resolutions however require taking measures to ensure stability, as the critical frequency $f_c$ is reduced below the plasma frequency of most metals when $\Delta x \gtrsim 200$ nm. % TODO check this
A trivial approach is to drastically reduce the Courant factor $S$ so that $f_c$ remains above plasma frequency. Although this should reliably avoid the instability, it would be so at the expense of scaling the computational time. As a general rule, lower resolution is typically chosen for larger structures, where also all investigated processes accordingly happen on a longer timescale.
%Drude model is known to introduce negative permittivity up to optical range, so 
%Assuming the critical frequency is far below the optical range, the Lorentz oscillators can be certainly neglected. Nonetheless, negative permittivity above critical frequency still introduces instability, which has to be resolved. 

For simulations with lower resolution, it is much more efficient to replace the exact Drude model with its approximation that maintains the same low-frequency limit of conductivity $\sigma_{LF}$, but has positive permittivity around the critical frequency and above it. 
This formally inverts the relations that describe the material:
\begin{itemize}
\item{
For \textit{high-resolution simulations}, $\omega_p$ and $\gamma$ are given as experimental properties of the metal, while $\sigma_{LF} = \omega_p^2\varepsilon_0\gamma^{-1}$ is determined by them and the nondispersive part of permittivity $\varepsilon_{r\infty} = 1$ is fixed to that of vacuum. 
} 
\item{
For \textit{low-resolution simulations}, the situation is opposite: $\sigma_{LF}$ is given as one experimental property, $\gamma < 2\pi f_c$ is given by the critical frequency, % TODO describe why so
whereas $\varepsilon_{r\infty}$ and $\omega_p$ are to be determined from the previous two input parameters.
} 
\end{itemize}
In this section we develop the strategy to determine the correct combinations of  $\gamma < 2\pi f_c$, $\varepsilon_{r\infty}$ and $\omega_p$.

\add{

%The value of $\gamma$ is also limited to be lower than $2\pi f_c$, so its value is fixed to be as close to $2\pi f_c$ as possible. % TODO ...is it? verify and add to the rules for stability written above
The values of the plasma frequency $\omega_p$ as well as the  $\varepsilon_{r\infty}$ remain to be freely manipulated.

        % Knowing the scattering frequency gamma, the virtual plasma frequency is now determined by lfconductivity
        $$ \omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma \sigma_{LF}}{\varepsilon_0}} $$

        % The following step is required for FDTD stability: 
        % Add such an high-frequency-epsilon value that shifts the permittivity to be positive at f_c
        % If self.eps>1, the frequency where permittivity goes positive will generally be less than f_p

\paragraph{Conductive media in FDTD} %{{{
The resonance frequency $\omega_0$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the restoring force in the harmonic oscillator. A conductive medium is characteristic by having part of the charges that do not experience any restoring force, so they can be modelled by an oscillator with a resonance frequency approaching zero: $\omega_0 \rightarrow 0$; in practice any value lower than the inverse of simulation time gives expected results.

%When $\omega_0$ is reduced to small values, the oscillator epsilon difference $\Sigma = \Delta \varepsilon_r$ has to be upscaled accordingly to keep the plasma frequency constant.
%When $\omega_0$ is reduced to small values, the oscillator strength $F$ shall be kept constant?

\paragraph{Debye media in FDTD} \label{fdtd_debye} %{{{
The Lorentz model can be employed also to define overdamped oscillators, corresponding to the processes where  $\gamma \gg \omega_0$, i.e. the inertia is negligible.
A typical example is the  reorientation of polar molecules in liquids or solids. 

It can be shown that for $\gamma \gg \omega_0$, the peak of $\varepsilon_r''(\omega)$ lies approximately on the frequency $\omega_p^{2}/\gamma$. The spectral width of such a peak is proportional to its central frequency.

\subsection{Plane-wave expansion method} % TODO
\paragraph{Principles of PWEM} %{{{
\add{

Another numerical method used is the plane-wave expansion method (PWEM). This method works in frequency-domain and, being based on eigenmode problem, is fundamentally different from FDTD. It is encouraging that both give similar results. The PWEM consists in expressing the structure permittivity in the inverse space, using spatial Fourier transformation. For any given wavevector, an eigenvalue problem can be solved; the resulting eigenvalues are the frequencies of different modes in the folded dispersion curves. 

For a given wavevector, PWEM gives also the shape of the fields for each mode. This approach turned out to be easier and more reliable than running the frequency-domain solver in FDTD selecting the approximate frequencies of the band edges, so we mostly used PWEM to get insight into how the modes look like. 
As a convenient implementation of PWEM, we used  the freely available program \textit{MPB}\cite{johnson2001mpb}, again from the \textit{ab-initio} group at MIT.

\paragraph{Comparison of PWEM to FDTD} %{{{
While the time-domain methods are very general, allowing to compute both periodic and non-periodic structures with losses or nonlinearity, some tasks may be better solved by more specialized methods.

\subsection{Transfer-matrix method} % TODO
\paragraph{} %{{{
\add{
The \textit{transfer-matrix method} (or \textit{Abelès formalism}) provides an analytically exact and notably simple computation of the transmission of one-dimensional, layered structures. It has been applied e.g. for the design of antireflective layers, dielectric mirrors, defect-mode filters etc. It shall be noted that extensions of TMM for two- or three-dimensional computation also exist \cite{pendry1992_transfer_matrix}, enabling to compute e.g. the reflection and transmission of structures discretized in a grid in frequency-domain. For simplicity, we describe the one-dimensional method.

The key concept is in dividing the structure into a sequence of homogeneous layers. For each layer, a $2\times 2$ \textit{transfer} matrix is prepared, that relates the $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf H$ of the forward and backward propagating waves. If the $m$-th layer has wave impedance $z_m$, refractive index $n_m$ and thickness $d_m$, the transfer matrix $\mathbb M^{(m)}$ is given as
\begin{equation} \mathbb M^{(m)} := \begin{pmatrix} \cos\delta & (i/\gamma)\sin\delta \\ i\gamma\sin\delta & \cos\delta \end{pmatrix},\quad\text{ where }\gamma:=1/z_m\text{ and }\delta := kn_m d_m.\label{eq_tmm1}\end{equation}
Multiplication of such matrices gives the total transfer matrix of the layered structure, 
\begin{equation} \mathbb M^{(tot)} \equiv \begin{pmatrix} m_{11} & m_{12} \\ m_{21} & m_{22} \end{pmatrix} = \ldots \cdot \mathbb M^{(2)} \cdot \mathbb M^{(1)}. \label{eq_tmm2}\end{equation}
The total reflection $r^{(tot)}$ and transmission $t^{(tot)}$ are then 
\begin{equation} r^{(tot)} = \frac{m_{11} + m_{12} - m_{21} - m_{22}}{m_{11} + m_{12} + m_{21} + m_{22}}, \quad\quad t^{(tot)}= \frac{2}{m_{11} + m_{12} + m_{21} + m_{22}}, \label{eq_rt_tmm}\end{equation}
if perpendicular only incidence is assumed and if the surrounding medium consists of air.

The TMM is instrumental not only for its obvious simplicity, but also for providing mathematical interpretation of observed phenomena and allowing to define arbitrary properties of the layers (whereas both FDTD and PWEM restrict e.g. the constituent permittivity to be positive).

\subsection{Summary} % TODO
This section described four fundamentally different numerical methods for electromagnetic simulations. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) is a time-marching method that describes the structure on an uniform grid, allowing to compute very general electromagnetic problems. Usually a short-time, broadband pulse excitation is used, which allows to resolve whole spectrum at once by Fourier transform. Two fundamentally different setups for FDTD are described in the following chapter that provide similar information on the metamaterial.} 
\item{Finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method uses the same discretisation as FDTD, but instead of time-marching and Fourier transforming the result, it searches for the field eigenmode at one given frequency by means of numerical optimisation. It is favorable e.g. for mode analysis in complicated structures.} 
\item{Plane-wave expansion method (PWEM) reformulates the problem of a wave propagating in a periodic structure by means of linear algebra. At a given wave vector, it allows to find eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies in the structure. This can be in turn employed to efficiently retrieve the dispersion curves.} 
\item{Transfer-matrix method (TMM) also allows to find dispersion curves and field shape. Although it can be extended to two or three dimensions, most popular is its one-dimensional implementation, which, thanks to its simplicity, can even give an analytical insight into the behaviour of planar structures.} 
\end{enumerate}
Other numerical methods are used, too. Finite-element methods (FEM) approximate the structure with a custom mesh of triangles or tetrahedra. The advantage is in describing the structure smoothly with relatively low number of elements of variable density; the downside is in that the mesh introduces additional entropy and the computation on the element is significantly slower compared to straightforward arithmetics in FDTD. FEM is usually used as a frequency-domain solver, though time-domain computations are possible, too. The efficiency of the FEM mesh is superior to the FDTD/FDFD uniform grid particularly for structures with great differences between scale, that is, when important tiny structures are surrounded by large free space. This was however not the case of the structures studied in this thesis.

The general electromagnetic methods, such as FDTD, FDFD or FEM, can be employed to wide variety of electromagnetic problems. Thanks to their versatility, different ways exist to retrieve effective parameters of metamaterials. We implemented two of them, and other approaches are mentioned at the end of this section.
\subsection{Scattering parameters}
\paragraph{Principle} %{{{
The scattering parameter retrieval, also known as \textit{s-parameter}, \textit{distributed impedance} or \textit{Nicolson-Ross-Weir} (NRW) method, has been employed for years % TODO
to retrieve the index of refraction $N$ and wave impedance $Z$ of a homogeneous material sample. It is based on the fact that, using Fresnel-Airy formulas, % TODO as shown in the appendix
one can easily compute the transmission $t$ and reflection $r$ from a slab of any material, provided its thickness $d$, index of refraction $N$ and wave impedance $Z$ are known.  If $r,t$ are known instead, the Fresnel-Airy formulas can be inverted to yield $N$ and $Z$ of the slab. The actual computation is thus denoted also as \textit{Fresnel inversion}.


Mathematically, this can always be done, and this method assigns some \textit{effective} parameters, $\Neff$ and $\Zeff$, even when the homogeneous sample is replaced with an inhomogeneous structure, such as a layer of a metamaterial. 
This method has the advantage of not requiring to inspect the fields inside the tested structure, as the retrieval is based only on the amplitude and phase of $r,t$. Thanks to being easy to realize both experimentally and numerically, with FDTD or other algorithms, %% (in fact, this is independent of FDTD, only to the time-marching methods) \cite{terao2011}
it has become apparently the most popular way to retrieve metamaterial parameters. 

The most often mentioned issue of this method is that the solutions have infinitely many branches, and it is necessary to establish which one should be chosen, and why. In this chapter we describe that this can in fact be relatively easily resolved, and in the Section \ref{sect_results} it is shown that the outcomes may be quite surprising.

Aside from yielding multiple branches, the physical interpretation of the data can get even more intricate when effective parameters are to be assigned to an inhomogeneous slab of a metamaterial. Due attention has to be paid to minimize the intrinsic imprecision of this method, as well as to establish the limits of its applicability. 
%}}}
\paragraph{Simulation setup} %{{{
\begin{figure}[h] \centering \includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/meep_geometry.pdf} \caption{The setup of the FDTD simulation for the scattering parameter method} \label{fg_fdtd_sparam} \end{figure} 
The setup of the simulation is depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_fdtd_sparam}. The wave is emitted from the source plane (green rectangle) with the $z$-axis. The source temporal shape was not critical for the simulation; a very short pulse, with spectrum spanning from the GHz range to ca. 5 THz was used. 

The periodic boundary conditions were set on the $x$- and $y$-axes, so that effectively an infinite metamaterial slab is simulated. On both faces perpendicular to the $z$ axis we added perfectly matched layers (PML) to absorb all radiation (pink blocks).  The electric and magnetic fields are averaged and recorded by the first monitor plane (blue rectangle) in each simulation step. 

The wave then enters the volume of the unit cell (delimited by empty rectangles) and interacts with the structure. Part of its energy is reflected back, part is passed through and part may be dissipated if the structure is lossy. The fields that passed through the structure are recorded by the second monitor plane. After the energy stored in the structure drops to small enough level, the FDTD simulation is terminated and the recorded fields are processed to obtain the complex-valued reflection $r(f)$ and transmission $t$ as functions of frequency. Before this procedure is described, a modification important for the accuracy of this setup has to be made.
%}}}

\paragraph{Avoiding detection of near-field in monitor planes} %{{{
%% Hynek's trick
With the obvious exception of an effectively one-dimensional structure of layers perpendicular to the wave propagation, any other structure will change the orientation of the electric and magnetic fields. Such a perturbation of the field will be mostly bound to the structure, and exponentially decaying with the distance in the form of an \textit{evanescent wave}.

An evanescent wave does not transport energy out of the structure into free space. However, some energy is stored in it. As a result, the energy can be exchanged to another structure if it approaches the zone of the evanescent wave. Even if no energy is transferred by the evanescent wave, the electromagnetic behaviour of a structure is generally dependent, which may for example manifest as resonances shifting up or down in frequency.

The impact of the near-field reaching out of a structure to the s-parameters method is twofold:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{First, computing a single layer of a metamaterial obviously more or less changes its behaviour. In the ideal case, a cell is surrounded by an infinite, periodic 3-D lattice of uniform cells.  Instead, in the s-parameter method, the near-field spreads into free vacuum at the front and rear sides. 

This issue seems to be inherent to the method, but its impact can be assessed by simulations of more than one unit cell. Generally, the retrieved $\Neff$ and $\Zeff$ values will depend on the number of layers being simulated. A single-cell simulation feels the absence of adjacent layers the most, whereas in a two-cell simulation the effect should be halved. Simulation of three (or more) cells results in different behaviour of the cells at the surface and inside, which possibly broadens the resonance frequency and can confuse the retrieval method.
 } 
 \item{Second, the monitor planes can not distinguish between the near-field or radiated wave, but only the latter is desired for the s-parameter computation. At very low frequencies or at frequencies around resonances, the near-field can significantly distort the retrieved parameters.

This can be resolved by adding a sufficient \textit{padding} between the metamaterial cell and the monitor plane. As the evanescent field decays exponentially, usually padding less than half of the unit cell size is sufficient to suppress all artifacts from near-field detection. In contrast, the propagating wave only gets an additional phase offset that can be easily compensated after the simulation. } 
 \end{enumerate}
To the knowledge of the author, such a shift of monitor planes has not been employed in any related paper. It efficiently resolves the second issue, and it does so at an acceptable expense of moderately extending the simulation volume.
\mdf{TODO figure here a-b-c}
%}}}
\paragraph{Scattering-parameter retrieval procedure} %{{{
The averaged electric and magnetic field recorded at the first monitor plane will be denoted as $E_{x}^{(1)}(t), H_{y}^{(1)}(t)$. Likewise, those of the second monitor plane will be $E_{x}^{(2)}(t), H_{y}^{(2)}(t)$. The typical time records are depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_sparam_timedomain}. The excitation pulse operated for ca. 2 ps, and excited two distinct resonances in the structure that both decayed exponentially in time, but with different rate, as is outlined by thin line segments. About 35 ps after the source, the stronger resonance reduces its intensity under that of the higher quality resonance, which can be clearly seen as a change of the decaying amplitude slope.
\begin{figure}[h] \caption{Time-domain records of the fields in the s-parameter-based retrieval method; absolute values of the (complex) fields} \centering \includegraphics[width=9.5cm]{img/sim_timedomain_debug.pdf} \label{fg_sparam_timedomain} \end{figure}

	The spectral resolution is determined by the length of the time record. As a general rule, the higher quality a resonance has, the sharper spectral features correspond to it. The case of short time record significantly clipping a resonance ringdown is equivalent to coarse sampling on the frequency axis, that can not fully resolve the shape of the resonance. From the Fourier-Plancherel theorem it follows that the energy stored in the resonance that is clipped has to disappear from the frequency domain, too. As a result, characteristic ringing in the spectra occurs. Using the convolution theorem [see Sect. \ref{subsection_local_resp}], it can be deduced that applying rectangular window in timedomain results in convolution with the sinc function in the spectrum. 

	Using a time window that has smooth shape does not improve spectral resolution, but it generally suppresses the visually distracting ringing. Before further processing, all four time records were multiplied by the envelope function $g(t)$:
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
	g(t) 	& = 1 \text{ for } t < 0.8 t_{sim} \\
		     & = \frac{1 + \cos\left(\pi \frac{t/t_{sim}-0.8}{1-0.8}\right)}{2}  \text{ for } t > 0.8 t_{sim},
\end{split}
\label{eq_}\end{equation}
which ensured that after 80 \% of the total simulation time $t_{max}$ the field starts dropping smoothly to zero, similar to the \textit{Hann window} function often used in digital signal processing.

By means of Fourier transform, the fields can be converted to frequency domain, as $\tilde E_{x}^{(1)}(t) \rightarrow \tilde E_{x}^{(1)}(f)$, and so on. The results are shown

$$\tilde A^{(out 2)}(f) := \tilde E_{x}^{(2)}(f) + \eta \tilde H_{y}^{(2)}(f), \quad \tilde A^{(in 2)}(f)  := \tilde E_{x}^{(2)}(f) - \eta \tilde H_{y}^{(2)}(f)$$.

$$s_{12}(\omega) \equiv t(f) := \tilde A^{(out 2)}(f) / \tilde A^{(in 1)}(f)$$



\add{
The required steps are to
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{convert all field records to frequency domain using the Fourier transform (FT),} 
 \item{employ the linearity of FT to decouple the electric and magnetic field amplitudes into the amplitudes of the forward  and backward propagating waves, } 
 \item{obtain the ratios of the reflected wave $E^{(B1)}$ (backward at first monitor) and transmitted wave $E^{(F2)}$ (forward at rear monitor) to the incident wave $E^{(F1)}$ (forward at first monitor), to obtain the reflection coefficient $r(f) = E^{(B1)} / E^{(F1)}$ and transmission coefficient $t(f) = E^{(F2)} / E^{(F1)}$, respectively, }
 \item{employ the Fresnel inversion to resolve the dispersion curves for the structure.} 
 \end{enumerate}
 %While the points 1--3 are rather straightforward, the Fresnel inversion deserves further discussion. As noted above, in a given time the wave in a periodic medium takes on the form of Bloch wave (\ref{eq_bloch}): 
 %$\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}Kz} \cdot \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r})$, i.e. it is a product of a harmonic \textit{envelope} and a cell-periodic \textit{mode}. Computing the dispersion curves involves computing the envelope wavenumber $K = K(f)$ for each frequency $f$ in the desired spectrum. The information about the mode $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r})$ is not used and instead the metamaterial cell is treated as if it was a homogeneous medium -- therefore this procedure is also called \textit{homogenisation}.

\add{
It shall be noted that although the structure consists of a single layer, transmission and reflection is measured in the form of radiated waves to compute effective parameters for an infinite structure. The energy transferred by near field (evanescent wave) is neglected here. 
The field components at the first monitor plane ($E_x^{(1)}, H_y^{(1)}$) and at the second one ($H_y^{(2)}, E_x^{(2)}$) give sufficient information for this, for instance at which frequencies are the photonic bands and which $K$-vector the wave will have.

The Fresnel coefficients give the reflection and transmission from an interface of two homogeneous media described\footnote{In the literature, the Fresnel coefficients are often expressed using the index of refraction instead of wave impedance; this holds for most media where $\mu = 1$ and therefore $n = 1/z$} by their impedances $z_1, z_2$:
\begin{equation} r_1 = \frac{z_2 - z_1}{z_2 + z_1}, \quad \quad \quad t_1 = \frac{2 z_2}{z_2 + z_1}, \quad \text{for perpendicular incidence}. \label{eq_fresnel}\end{equation}
The complex reflection $r_{s}$ and transmission $t_{s}$ of a homogeneous slab with given wave impedance $z$, index of refraction $n$ and thickness $d$ can be computed by summing the infinite series of internal reflections.
% todo expr
When the thickness of the slab $d$ and the frequency $f$ are known, the obtained formulae can be analytically inverted\cite{smith2002determination}, yielding its index of refraction:
\begin{equation} n = \frac{\arccos\left(\frac{1 - r^2+t^2}{2 t}\right) \cdot sign + 2\pi \cdot branch}{2\pi f d / c}, \label{eq_fresinvn}\end{equation}
and also its wave impedance:
\begin{equation} z= \pm \sqrt{\frac{\left[(1+r)^2 - t^2\right]}{(1-r)^2 - t^2}}. \label{eq_fresinvz}\end{equation}
The sign and branch of the refraction index, and the sign of wave impedance are not known a priori.  These three discrete-valued functions have to be selected during computation. The absence of abrupt skips in the spectra, passivity requirements (Im$(N) \geq 0$, Re$(Z) \geq 0$) and the Kramers-Kronig relations are a good verification of a correct solution. We have written routines that perform this task automatically after each FDTD simulation is run. Not knowing the index of refraction is equivalent to expressing the folded dispersion curves, so the postprocesing of FDTD data corresponds to unambiguous \textit{unfolding} of the dispersion curves.

\paragraph{Unambiguous arccosine} %{{{

We performed finite-difference time-domain simulations \cite{oskooi2010meep} to obtain
the frequency ($f$)-dependent complex reflection $r(f)$ and transmission coefficients
$t(f)$ of a sample composed of periodically distributed dielectric rods.

Knowing the complex $r(f)$ and $t(f)$ along with the sample thickness $d$, we may use the
classical algorithm to retrieve the effective parameters \cite{smith2002determination}:
\begin{equation}
	N_{\rm eff} = \frac{\pm \arccos\left(\frac{1 - r^2+t^2}{2 t}\right) + 2\pi \cdot m}{k
	\cdot d}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	Z_{\rm eff}~= \pm \sqrt{\frac{(1+r)^2 - t^2}{(1-r)^2 - t^2}} \label{eq_Z}
\end{equation}
where $k = 2\pi f/c$ is the wave vector in vacuum and $c$ is the speed of light.

The well-known complication of this approach is that the arccosine and square root are
ambiguous functions \cite{Simovski09}, yielding multiple solutions with different branches (indexed by an
integer $m$) and signs. 
We deal with a passive medium, consequently we impose
Im$(\Neff)>0$ and Re$(\Zeff)>0$. To facilitate processing of the results, we 
adopted an approach different from earlier published works \cite{Smith02,Chen04} %% Chen04 = http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.70.016608
that ensures the continuity of effective parameters as a function of frequency \add{on pure mathematical basis}. This
continuity is required by Kramers-Kronig relations for arbitrarily small losses
introduced in the system. The important point consists in identifying the branch cuts of
arccosine in the complex plane (Fig.\ \ref{fg_arccos}\add{a,b}). If, by increasing the frequency,
the arccos argument, $v = (1 - r^2+t^2)/(2 t)$, 
passes through the right branch cut [i.e.
for $v= u+i 0$ where $u>1$], the real part of arccos$(v)$ touches zero, whereas the
imaginary part is non-zero and changes its sign. The continuity is restored if, from this
frequency on, one reverses the sign of the arccos term \add{(point "R" in Fig. \ref{fg_arccos}c}). The situation is slightly more
complicated at the left branch cut [i.e. for $v = u+i 0$ with $u<-1$], where the
imaginary part of \mdf{$\arccos(v)$} experiences again a step-like change of the sign and the
real part reaches the value of $\pi$. The continuity is then restored upon a sign
reversal accompanied by a branch index change,  illustrated by the point "L" in Fig. \ref{fg_arccos}c. A correct
reconstruction of the arccosine therefore only requires to compute the integer-valued
branch rlong with the sign, both being functions of frequency. The sign of the
square root function is again chosen such than $Z$ is a continuous function of frequency.

It is also known that the phase of the reflectance depends on the surface termination for
noncontinuous materials. In the cases where the wavelength of the radiation in the
material is much larger than the unit cell dimensions this ambiguity becomes small. A
useful control of the effective sample properties can be made by changing the thickness
of the sample (number of unit cells along the wave vector). We have chosen a symmetric
geometry where the dielectric rod is positioned in the center of a square unit cell and
the total thickness of the sample is an integer multiple of the unit cell size. In this
geometry the retrieved effective parameters of our structure depend only negligibly on
the number of unit cells that we put in the $z$-direction.

\subsection{Terahertz generation and detection setup}%{{{
The numerical data could be in some cases corroborated by experimental measurement using the \textit{time-domain terahertz spectroscopy} (TDTS) in our laboratory. 

The approach is similar to that used in the FDTD simulations. A short, broadband pulse impinges the sample, one part of its energy is transmitted, another reflected and the rest is absorbed in the sample. The transmitted pulse is then recorded by the time-domain sampling setup. The resulting transmission is computed by means of Fourier transform as a complex spectrum, which is to be normalized by the spectrum of the incident pulse.

%The experimental geometry is somewhat similar to that used for FDTD simulations above. Also the results are similar: we get the complex amplitude transmission spectrum,  
\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{\textit{Experimental setup for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy}} \label{fg_exp} \centering 
	\includegraphics[width=12cm]{img/exp_THz_sampling.pdf}
\end{figure}

The crucial component of the terahertz generation and detection setup is a source of ultrashort optical pulses. We used \textit{Coherent Mira} femtosecond oscillator with mean power of 0.5 W, central wavelength 810 nm,  and a pulse duration under 70 fs. The optical pulses are split at beamsplitter (BS1) into the \textit{probe} branch and the \textit{sampling} branch. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item{The probe branch passed through a mechanical chopper, which is needed for synchronous detection, and impinged a terahertz emitter. The emitter, a biased interdigitated antenna on a fast-switching semiconductor, responds to an optical pulse by fast discharging and emitting of a broadband electromagnetic pulse with spectral components from 100 GHz to 3 THz. This pulse, denoted by red area to indicate its diffractive nature, passes through the sample under study followed by a pellicle beamsplitter (PBS) and finally impinges a ZnTe nonlinear crystal. } 
 \item{The \textit{sampling} branch reflects from a pair of mirrors on a delay line, acquiring a precisely controlled relative delay against the first branch. Then it is properly attenuated at filter (F1) and its polarisation is converted from linear to a circular one on a quarter-wave plate (QWP). The pellicle beamsplitter directs the optical beam along the axis of the terahertz beam.} 
\end{itemize}

%}}}
\subsection{Scheme for simultaneous measurement of reflection and transmission}%{{{
It is theoretically possible to measure the \textit{reflection spectrum} using TDTS in a similar way the transmission spectrum was measured. However, due to the complexity of such a setup and sensitivity to sample displacement, we did not use a second sampling branch for reflected signal. Instead of using two sampling schemes, it is possible to recover the amplitude and phase reflectivity of a sample by stacking it between a pair of thick (3 and 6 mm) sapphire slabs. Thanks to the relatively high refractive index of sapphire ($N \approx 3.4$), these slabs introduce several distinct  echoes into the transmission signal.

\begin{figure} \caption{A broadband pulse passes through a single layer of microspheres randomly arranged between two sapphire slabs and is sampled by electrooptical detection.}  \centering \includegraphics[width=12cm]{img/expe/sample_sapphires.pdf} \end{figure} \clearpage

If the beam divergence is neglected, each optical element can be characterised by its complex transfer function in the resulting spectrum. One needs to define three transmission functions for the beam passing the volume of the thin sapphire $A(f)$, thick sapphire $B(f)$ and of the sample $t(f)$, and two reflection functions for the beam reflected on sapphire-air interface $r_{A}(f)$ and on the sapphire-sample interface $r_S(f)$. 

The recorded overall signal has to be split into its first part  % TODO

%defines the temporal separation between the main pulse and the first echo.  The reflection and transmission of the sample can be simply reconstructed using numerical deconvolution. The results of this method were, unfortunately, less than ideal. Among the reasons may be the possible asymmetry of the studied layer between the slabs, beam divergence and very low signal of both transmission and particularly reflection in the stop-bands of the sample.

The propagation delay through $2\times 3$ mm of sapphire is roughly 70 ps, which defines the spectral resolution to 14 GHz. All spectral features in the sample transmission must be significantly broader than this value. Otherwise they not only could not be resolved, but most importantly, their ringdown would overlap in the time domain with the following echo, producing spurious results. Using a thicker sapphire could improve spectral resolution of this method, however it conflicts with the requirement for the beam being narrower than the sample \cite{nemec2009tunable} and, independently, of reducing the error caused by beam diffraction as noted in the following paragraph.

In the experiment, we observed substantial deviation  % TODO add some experimental data and  and reference them here
from the numerically predicted results, which were moreover sensitive to subtle changes in the parameters. We propose  several explanations for the experimental errors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The geometrical beam divergence can not be fully compensated by the transfer functions [$A(f)$, $B(f)$] of separate sapphire slabs. The deconvolution algorithm can amplify or attenuate different frequency components to compensate for the  longitudinal focus displacement of the first echo compared the focus of the first pulse. However, due to the hyperbolic shape of the gaussian beam with Rayleigh length $z_{R}$ similar to the sapphire thickness\footnote{As an approximate example, for the main frequency component $f = 1.5$ THz with wavelength $\lambda = c / f \approx 200$ $\upmu$m, for $\vartheta \lesssim 0.15$ rad as an estimated divergence of the beam from its axis, the Rayleigh half-length of a gaussian beam would be $z_{R} = \frac{\lambda}{\pi \vartheta^{2}} \gtrsim 2.8$ mm, i.e. roughly the thickness of the thinner sapphire.}, the overall effect of two sapphires can not be linearly predicted from two separate measurements of each of them.} 
 \item{The possible asymmetry of the sample with regards to the beam axis can substantially bias the measured reflectivity. This happened during the characterisation of the dielectric spheres, when the sapphire distance was defined by a $\approx$60$\upmu$m teflon spacer. The nonuniform size of the resonators required to attach them to one of the sapphire windows, which resulted in that their average and sub-average size fraction had strongly asymmetric position. } 
 \item{The sapphire slabs can influence the near field of resonances in some samples. This error should not manifest in transversally homogeneous samples (i.e. slabs), nor in samples that are made of dielectrics with much higher permittivity than that of sapphire. However for some samples such as metamaterial fishnets or other metallic resonators, the simulations confirm that resonant frequencies can be substantially altered by the vicinity of a dielectric. }
 \item{Finally, it follows from Eq. (\ref{}) % TODO reference the slab-index-retrieval procedure
 that the reliable reflection data can only be retrieved at frequencies where also the transmission amplitude is strong enough for the signal not to be dominated by noise. }
 \end{enumerate}

\section{Sample preparation} % TODO

\subsection{Preparation of dielectric rods and bars}
In the following section, the properties of thin dielectric rods are discussed. A similar sample used in experiment consisted of bars from strontium titanate (SrTiO$_{3}$) with  rectangular cross-section (see Fig. \ref{fg_ebars_exp}). These bars were fabricated by femtosecond laser micro-machining from a thin slab of the dielectric \cite{yahiaoui2011tunable}.

\subsection{Preparation of dielectric spheres}
Compared to the dielectric bars, the fabrication of the dielectric spheres can be extremely simplified by the \textit{spray-drying process}. In contrast with the expensive and time-consuming \textit{top-down} processes such as laser machining, etching or polishing, this is a typical \textit{bottom-up} process, where the particles are formed all within one procedure, though certain postprocessing is needed. The following technique in a collaborating laboratory in France %% Todo reference to Patrick's group somehow
provided us with high-permittivity TiO$_{2}$ spheres with the sizes from 30 to 100 $\upmu$m. 

\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{Microphotograph of the TiO$_{2}$ spheres after preliminary sieving} \label{fg_microphoto} \centering 
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{img/microscope_TiO2_particles.pdf}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Spray-dry process}
Rutile (TiO$_{2}$) was ground to a powder of sub-microscopic particles. 
A suspension of these nanoparticles in ethanol was sprayed into flame. The average size of particles was determined by the solid concentration in the suspension, by feed rate and by gas flow.It immediately formed spherical droplets, which dried up and sintered in the hot air.  

The resulting particles were annealed in a furnace to further solidify. By the temperature of the furnace, the degree of recrystallization could be controlled: from microscopic grains (at around 1200  $^{\circ}$C) to a sphere consisting of few crystalline domains, which were apparent in electron microscope (annealed at\footnote{From personal communication with Dr. Patrick Mounaix} 1300--1400 $^{\circ}$C). Note the temperatures used are still far below the melting temperature of rutile (i.e. 1800 $^{\circ}$C).

Only the low-temperature annealed samples were measured by the terahertz spectroscopy in this thesis. The fine-grained rutile was assumed to be well approximated by an isotropic dielectric. The size of the constituent crystalline grains was estimated from the observation of one microsphere ground on a glass of a pollarisation microscope: unlike polycrystalline aggregates, single rutile monocrystals manifest as coloured particles due to their inherent birefringence. Therefore, the size of crystalline grains were determined in the order of few micrometers.

Similar TiO$_{2}$ microspheres are also available commercially (e.g. from Brace, GmbH), and to the author's knowledge, they are made with a similar process.

\paragraph{Microsphere pre-sieving and other treatment}
The annealed spheres required further processing, as described by {Dr.} U-Chan Chung: 
\textit{
(\ldots) As the spheres have been sintered at high
temperature, they have been separated from a platinum plate with a
small soft paintbrush followed by a light milling with a agathe
mortar. The goal was to separate the spheres that are welded to their
neighbours due to the sintering step. All the spheres were treated in
ultrasound-bath using ethanol as liquid phase. After natural drying,
the sieving was performed. (\ldots) square (or rectangular)
holes sieves were used. The meshes used were 106, 100, 53, 50, 40 and 38
micrometer. As a dry sieving step was performed, the particles were
light milled again in order to try to break possible agglomerates which
would not go through the mesh. This process was repeated 2-3 times and
a final wet sieving with ethanol was performed in order to "wash" the
spheres. No special measures were taken according to their shapes. (\ldots)
}


\paragraph{Theory of anisotropic sieves}
Triple sieving on commercial sieves in Bordeaux, weaved from stainless steel wire, did not provide narrow enough size distribution. We therefore developed detailed methods of sample refinement and characterisation. 

\begin{figure}[h] \caption{\textbf{a)} \textbf{b)} } \label{fg_sieve_pass_notpass} \centering 
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/technology/sieve_pass_notpass.pdf}
\end{figure}
In the following, we approximated the dielectric particles by ellipsoids with three (generally different) half-axes $$r_a \leq r_b \leq r_c.$$ For the purpose of sieving, only the values of the shortest two axes, $r_a$ and $r_b$, decide whether the particle can pass through the sieve. The longest ellipsoid axis $r_c$ does not affect this, although it may influence the sieving speed. Therefore we can represent each 3-D particle with its projection on the smallest possible ellipse, which is described by its \textit{minor axis} $\equiv 2r_a$, and by its \textit{major axis} $\equiv 2r_b$. For a given shape of a hole in a homogeneous flat sieve, it is easy to determine which values of minor and major axes allow a particle to pass through, and which not. For a square sieve such area in the parameter space forms a disk around the center of origin (Fig. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass}a). It can be shown that when the sieve is diagonally stretched, forming a lozenge hole shape, the area of spheres allowed to pass changes into an ellipse (Fig. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass}b). When the hole shape is circular or elliptical, it is obvious that the area forms a part of a square or of a rectangle, respectively  (Fig. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass}c,d).

The resonance frequency of a dielectric resonator depends on all three half-axes, $r_a \leq r_b \leq r_c$. In order to select as narrow size fraction as possible, one has to use double sieving: the above sieve not allowing the fraction of particles too big, the bottom sieve removing the fraction of particles too small. This is where the anisotropic hole shapes become useful -- the bottom sieve can exclude also all oblong particles with the difference of $r_a \leq r_b$ too big. This effect is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fg_double_sieving}, which also presents a comparison of using more usual sieves of square/lozenge holes with the effect of a couple of sieves of micromachined square/elliptic holes. Obviously, the latter approach better discriminates for the \textit{shape} of the ellipsoid. This advantage further gains on importance when the anisotropy of the sieve is low.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/technology/sieve_double_sieving_fractions.pdf}
\end{figure}

% TODO 4x hole-sphere sketch  --->  maj-min binary funciton of (not)passing
It shall be noted that although we plotted a binary (\textit{pass}/\textit{not pass}) function in Figs. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass} and \ref{fg_double_sieving}, the sieving speed greatly differs for different sizes of particles. This is due to lower probability of a particle passing, if its parameters are near the edge of possible-passing function. 
%For any finite sieving time, this obviously affects the statistics of particles passing the sieve, favoring the average size to be lower for short sieving times. The particles that are close to 
However, this particular fraction of particles is exactly what one is interested in during the high-accuracy sieving! The process must therefore run for long enough time, in the order of days, and with as high sieving speed as possible.

\paragraph{First sieving apparatus}
 %Finally, they were carefully sieved in many iterations, to select a size fraction as narrow as possible.
Employing the idea of anisotropic sieves from Fig. \ref{fg_double_sieving}a, we assembled the first prototype based on nylon sieves, as depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_sieving1}. Two glass containers were lathed of a 
% diam
glass tube, and on their bottom, nylon sieves were glued. The side of the sieve holes was 60$\pm$5 $\upmu$m, and while the above sieve was kept isotropic, the bottom one was stretched by ca. 20-25 \% in diagonal direction. The nylon mesh was woven, so the threads easily bent aside, allowing oversized particles either to pass or to get stuck permanently, blocking the sieve within few minutes. To resolve the latter problem, two additional narrow glass rings were cut, with much coarser sieves glued on the bottom, to allow little spherical springs bounce beneath the sieves and to loosen the particles that got stuck in the holes. A cover on top prevented the particles to jump out of the above container. Whole stack was carefully lowered into a test tube with a greater diameter, and vibrated by a tiny electric motor glued on the bottom.

\paragraph{Second sieving apparatus}
\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{\textbf{a)} A sketch of the acoustic sieving device, and \textbf{b)} a photograph thereof} \label{fg_sieving2} \centering 
\textbf{a)}\includegraphics[height=8cm]{img/technology/sieve2_sieving_scheme.pdf}
\textbf{b)}\includegraphics[height=8cm]{img/technology/sieving_m.pdf}
\end{figure}
The partially promising results and, more importantly, obvious deficiencies of the previous apparatus motivated building a second one depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_sieving2}.
Different from any other sieving apparatus known to the author, this one made use of intense vertical acoustic wave for the movement of particles. It consisted of two coaxial glass tubes: The inner tube, with outer diameter of 13 mm, had a round metallic sieve glued to its bottom, and on its upper end it was covered by a 20 mm acoustic transducer. The outer tube (90 mm long, outer diameter 26 mm) surrounded the inner one and had a round bottom, where the particles collected. 
The gaskets ensured that whole apparatus was tightly closed, preventing both sieved particles and sound from escaping. The brass ring with the transducer was fixed to a massive aluminum stand, and the rest of the structure was clamped to it by two M3 screws with nuts that allowed for easy disassembly. 

The key advantages of this novel approach are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{\textbf{The speed of sieving} is roughly proportional to the frequency at which the particles hit the sieve. The acoustic frequency of 1 kHz is rouhly two orders of magnitude higher than in usual commercialy available devices. The spheres are moreover continuously stirred, so it is ensured that a layer of over-sized particles does not occupy the sieve.} 
 \item{The upward air pressure \textbf{pulls out particles that got stuck in the sieve} in every period of acoustic vibration. This resolves the major issue of the previous prototype.} 
 \item{\textbf{Avoiding macroscopic vibrating parts}, except the membrane of a small acoustic transducer, allows the device to operate over multiple days without the risk of mechanical failure of any part.}
 \end{enumerate}


The outer tube acted as an acoustic resonator, greatly enhancing the effect of the sound when tuned to resonance around 750-900 Hz. These frequencies obviously correspond to the fundamental acoustic resonance, as the quarter-wavelength is the range from 91 to 110 mm. 

%TODO The power of the sinewave feeding the device was limited by the parameters of the acoustic transducer
A practical deficiency of this setup was that the upper opening of the transducer radiated relatively intense sound during operation. We resolved this potential issue by covering whole apparatus by a robust glass bell jar.

With the acoustic power and frequency correctly adjusted, the particles formed a cloud 5--10 mm high. One difficulty arose from that the small particles tend to attach to the surface of glass or metal, probably due to electrostatic charges on their surface. While at an average particle radius $\rho = 50$ $\upmu$m this effect was rather marginal and transient, it took only few seconds of sieving for $\rho = 20$ $\upmu$m particles to immobilize permanently on any surface. It has however proven efficient to tap the upper brass ring, as the vibration released most spheres, effectively renewing the sieving process. To ensure unattended sieving for a timespan in order of days, we added a little motorized hammer with a timing circuit. % todo add photo of the hammer

The amount of particles in one batch was limited to ca. 10--20 mm$^{3}$, otherwise the sieve would be covered with a layer too thick, which could not be efficiently lifted by the acoustic pressure.
It could however be remedied by tilting the apparatus. With a tilt of 5--10 degrees, the bulk of particles then accumulated near one side, leaving most of the sieve surface free for sieving the moving fraction of particles. According to the small amount of particles required for the terahertz spectroscopy measurements, it is however advisable to sort a batch in order of 1--3 mm$^{3}$.

\add{Owing to the homogeneous broadening of the resonator resonance, caused by intrinsic losses of TiO$_{2}$, further sieving appears to lack any purpose. Not only this project broadens the numerous group of technically successful research projects pointed in utterly wrong direction, it also classifies into the lamentable subgroup of effort that could be entirely avoided if open and honest scientific discussion took place about the inherent problems. In this case, particularly, in all related papers it should be openly stated, that the dielectric losses of TiO2 prevent building any applicable volume metamaterial, no matter how accurately the resonators are prepared.}
