\section{Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy} \label{sect_tdts} 
\paragraph{Overview of the method}%{{{
The numerical data could be in some cases corroborated by experimental measurement using the \textit{time-domain terahertz spectroscopy} (TDTS) in our laboratory. 
% Note: it would be useful to find: Grüner - 1998 - Millimeter and Submillimeter Wave Spectroscopy of

The basic principle of the measurement was shared with the scattering-parameter retrieval in FDTD simulations presented later in Chapter \ref{chapter_sparam}.
 A short, broadband pulse impinged the sample, one part of its energy was transmitted, another reflected and the rest was dissipated in the sample. The transmitted pulse was then recorded by the time-domain sampling setup, and processed to obtain the transmission amplitude and phase as functions of frequency.

The reflection could not be directly measured in the setup described, but at the end of this section an indirect method is described that allows to compute the equivalent sample properties from the subsequent echoes, that are introduced when the sample is surrounded by thick transparent slabs of sapphire. 
In the following, we give details on the optical/terahertz setup.

\paragraph{Terahertz pulse generation}%{{{
As the source of ultrashort optical pulses, we used commercial \textit{Coherent Mira} titanium-sapphire femtosecond oscillator with mean power of 0.5 W, central wavelength 810 nm, repetition rate of 76 MHz and a pulse duration under 70 fs.  %TODO cite Pashkin?
% \cite{pashkin2004phd} In our TDTS measurements femtosecond laser ”Mira Seed” by COHERENT has been used for generation of ultrashort light pulses with following characteristics:
	%pulse length			50 - 80 fs
	%spectral bandwidth		15 - 40 nm	
	%repetition rate			76 MHz
	%energy per pulse		8 nJ      	
	%average power			650 mW
	%pulse peak power		140 kW    	

The laser output was split into two branches at the beamsplitter (BS1 in Fig. \ref{fg_exp}), one of which was used for the electrooptical sampling setup. The major part the energy passing through BS1 was converted to terahertz pulses using an interdigitated photoconductive emitter from TeraSED, whose principle of operation is described in the previous section. 
The voltage at the emitter was 15-20 V, and its polarity was modulated at the frequency of 91-92 kHz. This enabled to use synchronous lock-in detection to increase the noise-resistance of the detection system. % as described below.

%}}}
\paragraph{Vacuum chamber and sample holder}%{{{
The active region of the TeraSED emitter was of comparable diameter as the longer-wavelength component of of the THz pulse, so the beam diffraction led to a broad angle of the terahertz emission, in the order of 0.5 radian. Therefore, the wave was reflected at an ellipsoidal % TODO check if it was not paraboloidal
 mirror and refocused at the sample. Upon passing through it, it diffracted again and was collected by an identical ellipsoidal mirror and focused at the detector. 
To allow enough clearance for a bigger instrumentation surrounding sample, such as a liquid-helium cryostat or a heating furnace, the ellipsoidal mirrors were separated by 0.3 m and the whole beam path approached 0.6 m. % TODO check with a ruler

Propagation of terahertz waves in air over such a distance is impeded by absorption of water vapour, which is the only polar molecule found in the air with significant concentration. The absorption forms clear notches in the terahertz transmission spectra, for instance around 0.62, 0.75, 1.07 and 1.41 THz, which can be traced down to discrete rotational levels of the water molecules \cite{exter1989}. In time domain, the absorption manifests as a exponentially decaying ringdown that has polarity opposite to the main THz peak.
% TODO figure from my web
The whole terahertz wave path has to be confined in an environment free of water vapour, and the fastest way to reliably achieve this was to enclose the emitter, mirrors, sample and detector in a vacuum chamber evacuated by a two-stage rotary pump.

\paragraph{Terahertz detection setup}%{{{
\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{\textit{Experimental setup for the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy}} \label{fg_exp} \centering 
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/exp_THz_sampling.pdf}
\end{figure}

Before the laser pulse entered the vacuum chamber to induce the photoexcitation of the THz emitter, a small part of its energy was separated by a reflection from a microscope glass BS1 in Fig. \ref{fg_exp}) into the \textit{sampling} branch. 

The pulse in the \textit{sampling} branch reflected from a pair of mirrors on a delay line, acquiring a precisely controlled relative delay against the terahertz pulse. Then it was attenuated at a filter (F1) and its polarisation was converted from linear to a circular one on a quarter-wave plate (QWP). The pellicle beamsplitter (PBS) directed the optical beam along the axis of the terahertz beam. 

We used the electrooptic sampling mentioned in the previous chapter: The electric field of the terahertz pulse induced a slight transient change in the permittivity tensor of the zinc telluride crystal (ZnTe). The much weaker and shorter optical pulse was modified by this change, acquiring diagonal ellipticity that could be fine tuned for zero signal with the Babinet compensator (C). The Wollaston prism (WP) was be used to separate the two diagonal components of the resulting elliptic-polarized light. The difference between these two signals, if small modulation is assumed, proportional to the amplitude of the electric field. This allows to sample electric field with a theoretical temporal resolution given by the duration of the optical pulse, but using a standard intensity detection using a pair of silicon diodes.   
%% TODO add references to other papers and theses from our group - one can not describe everything from Gouy shift to PKGraph ...

%}}}
\paragraph{Signal processing and acquisition}%{{{
To reduce the noise, synchronous detection with the \textit{Stanford SRS360} lock-in amplifier was used, based on that the polarity of THz waveforms was modulated by the voltage at the TeraSED emitter. The difference signal at the two photodiodes, PD1 and PD2, was first fed to an analogue filter (with center frequency 91.3 kHz and 3 dB drop at $\pm$ 7 kHz), sampled by the lock-in amplifier and digitally normalized against the signal measured by the auxiliary photodiode PD3, as the difference signal is proportional not only to the terahertz field, but also to the laser intensity which may fluctuate over time. 

The time constant of the lock-in acquisition was comparable to the time which was needed by the delay lines to introduce a picosecond delay. As a result, the speed of delay lines movement suppressed the high-frequency components of the detected signal. Precise control of the delay line speed and timing, along with software compensation for this, was needed.

The spectral response of both the emitter and electrooptic sampling substantially influenced the measured spectra. Moreover, the phase of the recorded waves was modulated too, as a beam passing through a focus acquires additional phase due to the Gouy shift. Every transmission measurement was therefore normalized in frequency domain against a corresponding free-space reference, so that both the amplitude and phase artifacts cancelled out. 
%}}}
\paragraph{Scheme for simultaneous measurement of reflection and transmission}%{{{
With addition or rearrangement of optics, it would be theoretically possible to measure the \textit{reflection spectrum} using TDTS in a similar way the transmission spectrum was measured. However, due to the complexity of such a setup and sensitivity to sample displacement, we did not use a second sampling branch for reflected signal. Instead of using two sampling schemes, it is possible to recover the amplitude and phase reflectivity of a sample by stacking it between a pair of thick (3 and 6 mm) sapphire slabs \cite{nemec2012resonant}. Thanks to the relatively high refractive index of sapphire ($N \approx$ 3.068), these slabs introduce several distinct  echoes into the transmission signal.
%\begin{figure} \caption{A broadband pulse passes through a single layer of microspheres randomly arranged between two sapphire slabs and is sampled by electrooptical detection.}  \centering \includegraphics[width=12cm]{img/expe/sample_sapphires.pdf} \end{figure}			%% TODO no use for this figure?

If the beam divergence is neglected, each optical element can be characterised by its complex transfer function in the resulting spectrum. One needs to define three complex transmission functions: for the beam passing through the volume of the thin sapphire $A(f)$, of the thick sapphire $B(f)$ and through the thin sample $t(f)$. Additionally two reflection functions for the beam reflected on sapphire-air interface $r_{A}(f)$ and on the sapphire-sample interface $r_S(f)$
Measuring the references of the thin and thick sapphires separately, the spectra of $A(f)$ and $B(f)$ as well as $r_{A}(f)$ can be established \cite{nemec2012resonant}. 

%defines the temporal separation between the main pulse and the first echo.  The reflection and transmission of the sample can be simply reconstructed using numerical deconvolution. The results of this method were, unfortunately, less than ideal. Among the reasons may be the possible asymmetry of the studied layer between the slabs, beam divergence and very low signal of both transmission and particularly reflection in the stop-bands of the sample.

To retrieve the characteristics of the sample, i.e. $t(f)$ and $r_S(f)$, the overall transmission signal of the sapphire-sample-sapphire structure has to be split into two parts that correspond to the direct pass, and the first echo arising from the pulse reflecting back and forth  in the thin sapphire.
The propagation delay through $2\times 3$ mm of thin sapphire is roughly 70 ps, which defines the spectral resolution of 14 GHz. All spectral features in the sample transmission must be significantly broader than this value. Otherwise they not only could not be resolved, but most importantly, their temporal ringdown would overlap in the time domain with the following echo, producing spurious results. Using a thicker sapphire could improve spectral resolution of this method, however it conflicts with the requirement for the terahertz beam fitting into the area of the sample\cite{nemec2009tunable} and, independently, of reducing the error caused by beam diffraction as noted in the following paragraph.

In the experiment, we observed substantial deviation  % TODO add some experimental data to {results} and  reference them here
from the numerically predicted results, which were moreover sensitive to subtle changes in the parameters. We propose  several explanations for the experimental errors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The geometrical beam divergence can not be fully compensated by the transfer functions [$A(f)$, $B(f)$] of separate sapphire slabs. The deconvolution algorithm can amplify or attenuate different frequency components to compensate for the  longitudinal focus displacement that the first echo has compared to the focus of the first pulse. However, due to the hyperbolic shape of the gaussian beam with Rayleigh length $z_{R}$ similar to the sapphire thickness\footnote{As an approximate example, for the main frequency component $f = 1.5$ THz with wavelength $\lambda = c / f \approx 200$~$\upmu$m, for $\vartheta \lesssim 0.15$ rad as an estimated divergence of the beam from its axis, the Rayleigh half-length of a gaussian beam would be $z_{R} = \frac{\lambda}{\pi \vartheta^{2}} \gtrsim 2.8$ mm, i.e. roughly the thickness of the thinner sapphire.}, the overall effect of two sapphires can not be linearly predicted from two separate measurements of each of them.} 
 \item{The possible asymmetry of the sample with regards to the beam axis can substantially bias the measured reflectivity. This happened during the characterisation of the dielectric spheres, when the sapphire distance was defined by a $\approx$60$\upmu$m teflon spacer. The nonuniform size of the resonators required to attach them to one of the sapphire windows, which resulted in that their average and sub-average size fraction had strongly asymmetric position. } 
 \item{The sapphire slabs can influence the near field of resonances in some samples, c.f. Sect. \ref{par_nearfield}. This error should not be significant in transversally homogeneous samples (i.e. slabs), nor in samples that are made of dielectrics with much higher permittivity than that of sapphire. However for some samples such as metamaterial fishnets or other metallic resonators, the simulations confirm that resonant frequencies can be substantially altered by the vicinity of a dielectric. }
 \item{Finally, it follows from Eq. (\ref{eq_slab_index_retrieval}) % TODO reference the slab-index-retrieval procedure
 that the reliable reflection data can only be retrieved at frequencies where also the transmission amplitude is strong enough for the signal not to be dominated by noise. }

\section{Fabrication of the titanium dioxide microspheres}
% todo having discussed the measurement, we proceed to the fabrication of samples
%The samples dielectric microspheres were manufactured by one of the collaborating groups.
\paragraph{Preparation of dielectric sphere samples by the spray-dry process}%{{{
The collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Patrick Mounaix in France %% Todo reference to Patrick's group somehow, and mention Oleg Mitrofanow (here, or later)
provided us with high-permittivity TiO$_{2}$ spheres with the sizes from 30 to 100 $\upmu$m, which were examined by the terahertz spectroscopy as dielectric resonators, and possible constituents of a metamaterial with a negative effective permeability.
\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{Microphotograph of the TiO$_{2}$ spheres after preliminary sieving} \label{fg_microphoto} \centering 
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{img/microscope_TiO2_particles.pdf}
\end{figure}

Compared to most metamaterial designs, the fabrication of the dielectric spheres can be extremely simplified by the \textit{spray-drying} technique. In contrast with the expensive and time-consuming \textit{top-down} processes such as laser machining, litography or polishing, this is a typical \textit{bottom-up} process, where the particles are formed all within one procedure, though certain postprocessing is needed. 
Rutile (TiO$_{2}$) was ground to a powder of sub-microscopic particles. 
A suspension of these nanoparticles in ethanol was sprayed into flame. The average size of particles was determined by the solid concentration in the suspension, by feed rate and by gas flow. It immediately formed spherical droplets, which dried up and sintered in the hot air.  
The resulting particles were annealed in a furnace to further solidify. The degree of recrystallization could be controlled by the temperature of the furnace from microscopic grains (at around 1200  $^{\circ}$C) to a sphere consisting of few crystalline domains, which were apparent in electron microscope (annealed at\footnote{Procedure details are from the personal communication with Dr. Patrick Mounaix and {Dr.} U-Chan Chung} 1300--1400 $^{\circ}$C). Note the temperatures used are still far below the melting temperature of rutile (i.e. 1800 $^{\circ}$C).

Similar TiO$_{2}$ microspheres are also available commercially (e.g. from Brace, GmbH), and to the author's knowledge, they were made with a similar process.

Only the low-temperature annealed samples were measured by the terahertz spectroscopy in this thesis. The fine-grained rutile was assumed to be well approximated by an isotropic dielectric. The size of the constituent crystalline grains was estimated from the observation of one microsphere ground on a glass of a pollarisation microscope: unlike polycrystalline aggregates, small rutile monocrystals appear as coloured particles due to their inherent birefringence. Therefore, the size of crystalline grains were determined in the order of few micrometers.
The annealed spheres were further processed with the aim to break or eliminate clusters, by means of light milling with agathe mortar, which was separated afterwards by ultrasound bath cleaning in ethanol. Pre-sieving was performed on commercial sieves with 100, 53, 50, 40 and 38 $\upmu$m size of the square hole. The milling-cleaning-sieving procedure was repeated 2-3 times.
%\textit{
%(\ldots) As the spheres have been sintered at high temperature, they have been separated from a platinum plate with a small soft paintbrush followed by a light milling with a agathe mortar. The goal was to separate the spheres that are welded to their neighbours due to the sintering step. All the spheres were treated in ultrasound bath using ethanol as a liquid phase. After natural drying, the sieving was performed. (\ldots) square (or rectangular) holes sieves were used. The meshes used were 106, 100, 53, 50, 40 and 38 micrometer. As a dry sieving step was performed, the particles were light milled again in order to try to break possible agglomerates which would not go through the mesh. This process was repeated 2-3 times and a final wet sieving with ethanol was performed in order to "wash" the spheres. No special measures were taken according to their shapes. (\ldots) }

\paragraph{Theory of anisotropic sieves}%{{{
Triple sieving on commercial sieves, weaved from stainless steel wire, did not provide narrow enough size distribution, which is however essential for obtaining a narrow collective resonance peak of the sample. We therefore developed a more exact method for very fine sample sieving and characterisation. 

\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{Correspondence between the hole shape (above) and the set of ellipsoids that can pass through the hole (below), determined by their medium and minor axes. Somewhat surprisingly, the \textbf{(a)} square and \textbf{(b)} lozenge holes result in circular/elliptic set of passing particles, whereas the \textbf{(c)} circular and \textbf{(b)} elliptic holes result in the square/rectangular shape of such an region.\\
For clarity, some limiting-case examples of the ellipsoid projection and the equivalent position on the minor-major ellipse axis plot are drawn in blue, violet and red. } \label{fg_sieve_pass_notpass} \centering 
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/technology/sieve_pass_notpass.pdf}
\end{figure}
In the following, the dielectric particles are approximated by ellipsoids with three (generally different) half-axes $$\rho_a \leq \rho_b \leq \rho_c.$$ For the purpose of sieving, only the values of the shortest two half-axes, $\rho_a$ and $\rho_b$, decide whether the particle can pass through the sieve. The longest ellipsoid half-axis $\rho_c$ does not affect this, although it may influence the sieving speed. Therefore we can represent each three-dimensional particle with its projection on the smallest possible ellipse, which is described by its \textit{minor axis} $\equiv 2\rho_a$, and by its \textit{major axis} $\equiv 2\rho_b$ (which is, in fact, the \textit{medium} axis of the ellipsoid). For a given shape of a hole in a homogeneous flat sieve, it is easy to determine which values of minor and major ellipse axes allow a particle to pass through, and which not. For a square sieve such area in the parameter space forms a disk around the center of origin (Fig. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass}a). It can be shown that when the sieve is diagonally stretched, forming a lozenge hole shape, the area of spheres allowed to pass changes into an ellipse (Fig. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass}b). When the hole shape is circular or elliptical, it is obvious that the area forms a part of a square or of a rectangle, respectively  (Fig. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass}c,d).

The resonance frequency of a dielectric resonator depends on all three half-axes, $\rho_a \leq \rho_b \leq \rho_c$. In order to select as narrow size fraction as possible, one has to use double sieving: the above sieve not allowing the fraction of particles too big, the bottom sieve removing the fraction of particles too small. This is where the anisotropic hole shapes become useful -- the bottom sieve can exclude also all oblong particles with the difference of $\rho_a \leq \rho_b$ too big. This effect is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fg_double_sieving}, which also presents a comparison of using more usual sieves with square/lozenge holes to the effect of a couple of sieves with micromachined square/elliptical holes. Obviously, the latter approach better discriminates for the \textit{shape} of the ellipsoid. This advantage further gains on importance when the anisotropy of the sieve is low.

\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{Application of the effect from Fig. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass} for separating a narrow fraction of ellipsoids between the sieves. Both combinations of \textbf{(a)} square-rectangular and \textbf{(b)} circular-elliptic sieves can be used, with the latter one promising better selectivity also in terms of the particle aspect ratio.} \label{fg_double_sieving} \centering 
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/technology/sieve_double_sieving_fractions.pdf}
\end{figure}
It shall be noted that although we plotted a binary (\textit{pass}/\textit{not pass}) function in Figs. \ref{fg_sieve_pass_notpass} and \ref{fg_double_sieving}, the sieving speed greatly differs for different sizes of particles. This is due to lower probability of a particle passing, if its parameters are near the edge of possible-passing function. 
%For any finite sieving time, this obviously affects the statistics of particles passing the sieve, favoring the average size to be lower for short sieving times. The particles that are close to 
However, this particular fraction of particles is exactly what one is interested in during the high-accuracy sieving. The process must therefore run for long enough time, in the order of days, and with as high sieving speed as possible.
%}}}
\paragraph{First sieving apparatus}%{{{
%Finally, they were carefully sieved in many iterations, to select a size fraction as narrow as possible.
Employing the idea of anisotropic sieves from Fig. \ref{fg_double_sieving}a, the author assembled the first prototype based on nylon sieves, as depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_sieving1}. Two glass containers were cut on a lathed from a 
% diam
glass tube, and on their bottom, the sieves were glued and round-clipped. The side of the sieve holes was 60$\pm$5 $\upmu$m. The above sieve was kept isotropic. 
The mesh was woven of nylon threads, so the bottom sieve could easily be stretched by ca. 20-25 \% in diagonal direction. 
This  property however prove to be also detrimental for precise sieving, as the threads easily bent aside under only a small force, thus allowing oversized particles either to pass or to get stuck permanently and to block the sieve within few minutes. To resolve the latter problem, two additional narrow glass rings were cut, with much coarser sieves  with 150 $\upmu$m pitch glued on the bottom, to allow little spherical springs bounce beneath the sieves and to loosen the particles that got stuck in the holes. A cover on top prevented the particles to jump out of the above container. Whole stack was carefully lowered into a test tube with a greater diameter, and vibrated by a tiny electric motor glued on the bottom.

\paragraph{Second sieving apparatus}%{{{

\end{figure}
The partially promising results and, more importantly, obvious deficiencies of the previous apparatus motivated the construction a second one depicted in Fig. \ref{fg_sieving2}.
Different from any other sieving apparatus known to the author, this one made use of intense vertical acoustic wave for the movement of particles. It consisted of two coaxial glass tubes: The inner tube, with outer diameter of 13 mm, had a round metallic sieve glued to its bottom, and on its upper end it was covered by a 20 mm acoustic transducer. The outer tube (90 mm long, outer diameter 26 mm) surrounded the inner one and had a round bottom, where the particles collected. 
The gaskets ensured that whole apparatus was tightly closed, preventing both sieved particles and the sound from escaping. The brass ring with the transducer was fixed to a massive aluminum stand, and the rest of the structure was clamped to it by two small screws with nuts that allowed for easy disassembly. 

The key advantages of this novel approach are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item{The speed of sieving is expected to grow with the frequency at which the particles hit the sieve. The acoustic frequency of 1 kHz is roughly two orders of magnitude higher than in usual commercially available devices. The spheres are moreover continuously stirred, so it is ensured that a layer of over-sized particles does not occupy the sieve.} 
 \item{The upward air pressure pulls out particles that got stuck in the sieve in every period of acoustic vibration. This resolves the major issue of the previous prototype.} 
 \item{Avoiding macroscopic vibrating parts, except the membrane of a small acoustic transducer, allows the device to operate over multiple days without the risk of mechanical failure of any part.}
 \end{enumerate}
The outer tube acted as an acoustic resonator, greatly enhancing the effect of the sound when tuned to resonance around 750-900 Hz. These frequencies obviously correspond to the fundamental acoustic resonance, as the quarter-wavelength is in the range from 91 to 110 mm. 

%TODO The power of the sine wave feeding the device was limited by the parameters of the acoustic transducer
A practical deficiency of this setup was that the upper opening of the transducer radiated relatively intense sound during operation. We resolved this potential issue by covering whole apparatus by a robust glass bell jar.

With the acoustic power and frequency correctly adjusted, the particles formed a cloud 5--10 mm high. One difficulty arose from that the small particles tend to attach to the surface of glass or metal, probably due to electrostatic charges on their surface. While at an average particle radius $\rho = 50$ $\upmu$m this effect was rather marginal and transient, it took only few seconds of sieving for $\rho = 20$ $\upmu$m particles to immobilize permanently on any surface. It has however proven efficient to tap the upper brass ring, as the vibration released most spheres, effectively renewing the sieving process. To ensure unattended sieving for a timespan in order of days, we added a little motorized hammer with a timing circuit. % todo add photo of the hammer

The amount of particles in one batch was limited to ca. 10--20 mm$^{3}$, otherwise the sieve would be covered with a layer too thick, which could not be efficiently lifted by the acoustic pressure.
It could however be remedied by tilting the apparatus. With a tilt of 5--10 degrees, the bulk of particles then accumulated near one side, leaving most of the sieve surface free for sieving the moving fraction of particles. According to the small amount of particles required for the terahertz spectroscopy measurements, it is however advisable to sort a batch in order of 1--3 mm$^{3}$.

\section{Optical determination of microparticle statistics}
%{{{
Accurate characterisation of the particle statistics was necessary not only to assess the efficacy of sieving, but also to explain possible difference between the measured terahertz spectra and the computed ones on a quantitative basis. To obtain reliable statistics, thousands of particles needed to be evaluated, repeatedly for every sample. This, along with the small dimensions of particles, indicated that the most viable way to do so would be the optical microphotography with computer image processing automatically resolving each particle.

Computer granulometry
%, identification and measurement of photographed particles
is a well-established technique, and is implemented in several advanced image processing programs, of which \textit{ImageJ} was selected \cite{abramoff2004image}. 
The transmission microphotographs were acquired either with the lowest magnification on a laboratory microscope, or with a portable microscopic digital camera, yielding similar results.
The first operation on the somewhat blurred photographs [see Fig. \ref{fg_sievingstats}(a)] was to establish the intermediate brightness level between the image's bright and dark areas, and apply a threshold so that the image was a binary function. Then the \textit{ImageJ}'s \textit{watershed} algorithm was applied to relatively reliably resolve two or more touching particles, and a particle outline was found [cyan lines in \ref{fg_sievingstats}(b)]. Finally, the particle outlines were fitted by ellipses. 
\begin{figure}[ht] \caption{\textbf{(a)} A small section of a microphotograph of a pre-sieved sample before applying the described double-sieve method, \textbf{(b)} the corresponding identification of particles in ImageJ} \label{fg_sievingstats} \centering 
\textbf{(a)}\includegraphics[height=5cm]{img/technology/imagej_photo.pdf}
\textbf{(b)}\includegraphics[height=5cm]{img/technology/imagej_found.pdf}
\end{figure}
We accompanied the built-in granulometric algorithm of \textit{ImageJ} with a script enabling to process multiple photographs in a batch, and to plot the resulting histograms of the ellipse axes distribution. The script has also been published online \cite{dominec2014_imagej}. The microphotograph scale was determined from a separate photograph of a ruler.

An intrinsic deficiency of this method results from that it was not possible to resolve the third dimension of particles. 
It can be however estimated that if % TiO$_{2}$ 
ellipsoidal particles were randomly sprinkled on the glass, they would lie on their flat side -- i.e. their orientation would enable to measure the \textit{medium} $\rho_b$ and \textit{major} axis $\rho_c$ of the ellipsoid. This is in contrast with the process of sieving, as described above, where the particles were discriminated according to their and \textit{minor} $\rho_a$ and \textit{medium} $\rho_b$ axes. 
The error is however somewhat reduced by the non-ellipsoidal shape of the particles, which presumably prevented them from free overturning. %% NOTE this again when showing sphere experimental spectra

\section{Laser micro-machining}
\paragraph{Fabrication of dielectric bars}%{{{
Dielectric or metallic structures can be made by cutting a thin polished slab of the given material. For instance, metamaterials designed to operate around 1 THz, which corresponds to the free-space wavelength of 0.3 mm, have their unit cells of a similar size or less, and the finest features are usually an order of magnitude smaller. 
A similar sample used in experiment consisted of bars from strontium titanate (SrTiO$_{3}$) with a rectangular cross-section (see Fig. \ref{fg_STO_bar_geom}), 
where a structure with 10--30 $\upmu$m resolution was written into a thin slab of the dielectric of a similar thickness \cite{yahiaoui2011tunable}.

If the slab is made of a monocrystal or a ceramic, it is usually extremely brittle and also sensitive to breaking due to thermal stresses. Femtosecond laser micro-machining can alleviate both problems thanks to evaporating most of the heated material before the heat can spread by thermal conduction. Fabrication of the strontium titanate bars was accomplished by the professional Alphanov facility in France.

\paragraph{Fabrication of sieves and fishnet metamaterial layers}%{{{
Compared to the dielectrics, femtosecond machining of metallic sheets into meshes is relatively easy and was implemented in our laboratory. Machining of free-standing wire media was not succesfull and no such sample was finished, as the resulting thin wires were bent out of their original plane and their spacing was uneven.

The meshes had two purposes -- either as sieves used in the second sieving apparatus described above, or as metamaterial samples known as \textit{fishnets}, which are predicted to possibly have negative index of refraction (see Sect. \ref{section_fishnet}). 
The femtosecond laser used was different from that serving as the femtosecond source for terahertz spectroscopy (Sect. \ref{sect_tdts}). More than sufficient power was provided by the \textit{Spectra Physics Spitfire Ace} multipass titanium-sapphire amplifier, with 1 mJ in ca. 50 fs impulses, at 5 kHz repetition rate; its output beam had to be attenuated to obtain finer cut at the expense of slightly slower speed. The mechanical part consisted of two crossed \textit{Owis} stepper-motor controlled linear stages, and a fast mechanical shutter allowed to control the beam with a sufficient resolution of ca. 100 ms.

The 3 mm wide beam was focused by an anti-reflexed lens with a focal length of 10 mm or 50 mm, with the tighter focusing giving slightly better results. Particularly with the focal length of 10 mm, it was important to accurately focus the beam. To this end, we made use of back-collimation of the reflected beam as follows: When the metal sheet was exactly in focus, the reflection of the (focused) beam was again collimated by the lens into a non-diverging beam. Separating a part of the reflected beam energy sideways by a skewed glass in front of the lens, one could fine-tune the lens position seeking for the smallest spot diameter on a distant screen.

A compact stepper-motor controller of a custom design \cite{dominec2015_triostepper} facilitated the operation by the means of Python scripting, which allowed to compose the shutter opening, movement and shutter closing into one hole-drilling sequence, which could be composed to cut out the whole mesh structure. Finally, multiple different meshes with different parameters could be made on one metal sheet in a batch, without user interaction.

To achieve the required precision of sieving, we fabricated the sieves by femtosecond laser drilling of 20--30 $\upmu$m thick stainless steel sheets (Fig. \ref{fg_microfab}). 
%These sieves then were employed in a device that subjected the microsphere sample to acoustic vibrations, improving the speed of the demanding sieving process to acceptable level (Fig. \ref{fg_microfab}b,c).
