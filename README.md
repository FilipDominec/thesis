==== Finally ====
 * [ ] resolve that `t' denotes transmittance and time simultaneously?
 * [ ] go through all TODOs 
 * [ ] make index of kwords https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing?
 * [ ] aa [a-z]-[a-z] *tex
 * [ ] some figures should change from a)  to  (a) etc.
 * [ ] generate nice polar plots (Smith charts) for normal and Fano resonances

%Two oscillators with nearly the same frequency:
%electric+electric or magnetic+magnetic → strong coupling, leads to twice curled curve in polar plot
%electric+magnetic → weak or no coupling (magnetic dipole: H field even, Efield odd; electric dipole: H field odd, E field even → may be regarded as zero inner product of the field functions)
%interpreting resonance (and Fano-resonance) curves
	%wave in free space → s12 ampli constant, phase constantly growing; (s11 zero)
	%→  in polar plot: a clockwise rotating unit vector
	%reflective surface → s11 ampli constant, phase constantly growing; (s12 zero)
	%simple resonance (in SRR?) 
	%→  reflectance peak
	%if fres1 < fres2 → …
