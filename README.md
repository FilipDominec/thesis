%putting two resonances of the same type near to each other annihilates their “wings”
%→ hard to make a broadband-operating passive MM
%Metal eps spectra
%different models: Drude, lossy Drude
%spatial view of E+M wave propagation  (propagating/standing wave)
%in free space
%in arbitrary electromagnetic material 
%reflection on metal surface (PEC) and on PMC
%surface plasmons, standing/propagating
%non-lossy and lossy metal (-> quasi-bound states)
%Capacitive, inductive, resistive coupling?
%a “fast” and a “slow” resonance superposed?
%Two oscillators with nearly the same frequency:
%electric+electric or magnetic+magnetic → strong coupling, leads to twice curled curve in polar plot
%electric+magnetic → weak or no coupling (magnetic dipole: H field even, Efield odd; electric dipole: H field odd, E field even → may be regarded as zero inner product of the field functions)
%interpreting resonance (and Fano-resonance) curves
	%wave in free space → s12 ampli constant, phase constantly growing; (s11 zero)
	%→  in polar plot: a clockwise rotating unit vector
	%reflective surface → s11 ampli constant, phase constantly growing; (s12 zero)
	%simple resonance (in SRR?) 
	%→  reflectance peak
	%if fres1 < fres2 → …
	%find out the difference between:
	%two coupled broad resonances with interaction inbetween?

%Scaling and non-scaling properties [Zhou PRL 2005]
%Babinet principle
%diluted metal → Pendry1996's low frequency plasmons
%Bianisotropy and chirality
