== Introduction ==
beta - needs checkup + finish

sectioning:
+ motivation for this thesis
+ motivation for THz
+ contents

== Theory ==
+ write that T === k x k x
+ wave equation with the det[TE - c omega2/kk eps]] 
+ (... the equation is quartic, what are its 4 solutions?)
+ finish the discussion of k,vg, S orientation, (discuss information velocity)

+ (Bloch theorem illustration: eiKr, u(r), both  vs. another   eiKr, u(r), both  )
+ BLOCH THEOREM PROOF (that the wave is not growing/decaying + classical proof without commutator)

- somehow decide WHERE should the Fresnel coeffs and impedance be defined

+ MM/PhC differences - this is OK, but needs expansion and more quotations

+ (Available materials? - ask my advisor)

== Numerical methods ==
+ PWEM principle (2 pages max)
+ TMM principle write down (3 pages max)

+ CDH	!! implemenation of epsLL retrieval!
+ ((wedge refraction)
+ (other effparam methods)

== Experimental methods ==
+ Nonlinear up-conversion of microwaves
* needs check

== Results ==
== Conclusion ==
+ achievements
	+ When one can use N, 
	+ Unambiguous N retrieval, and resulting nontrivial conclusions
	+ 
== Appendices ==

----
== Global tasks ==
* add citations
* (change +iwt to -iwt ?)
* disperse the historical remarks
