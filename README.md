sectioning:

== Theory ==
+ (Bloch theorem illustration: eiKr, u(r), both  vs. another   eiKr, u(r), both  )

- somehow decide WHERE should the Fresnel coeffs and impedance be defined

+ MM/PhC differences - this is OK, but needs expansion and more quotations

== Numerical methods ==
+ PWEM principle (2 pages max)
+ CDH	!! implemenation of epsLL retrieval!
+ ((wedge refraction)
+ (other effparam methods)

== Experimental methods ==
+ Nonlinear up-conversion of microwaves
* needs check

== Results ==
== Conclusion ==
+ achievements
	+ When one can use N, 
	+ Unambiguous N retrieval, and resulting nontrivial conclusions
	+ 
+ Kramers-Kronig check of the RodArray spectrum (or some other?)
== Appendices ==

----
== Global tasks ==
* add citations
* (change +iwt to -iwt ?)
